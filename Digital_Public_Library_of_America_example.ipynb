Includes bibliographical references. As the title suggests, this thesis comprises several works of creative nonfiction. First, &quot;Zen and the Art of Conquest&quot; presents an incomplete narrative, in six chapters, that draws inspiration from Robert Pirsig\\'s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) and other travelogues. In Chapter One, the author embarks on a road trip to Las Vegas that seems haunted by his past--that is, his Peace Corps service in Kyrgyzstan, where &quot;the killing started&quot; just a month ago. Chapter Two begins with a flashback from an earthquake that preceded the killing, but then moves back to the road, where the author has reached Prineville, Oregon, also a stop on Pirsig\\'s journey. Pushing farther south, in Chapter Three, through Indian country, the author recalls childhood memories of Cathlapotle, a Chinook village described in Lewis and Clark\\'s journals. Chapter Four profiles the author\\'s father and grandfather, who devoted themselves to unearthing a Mayan graveyard in Guatemala. The Maya\\'s ancestors migrated south from Asia and then Oregon, the author discovers, and this fact drives his thinking in Chapter Five. He\\'s determined to reach Las Vegas because he wants to put questions about what happened in Kyrgyzstan to a former Peace Corps volunteer living there with his Kyrgyz wife. Chapter Five concludes with the author\\'s arrival in Osh, the scene of the killing, and Chapter Six alternates between his approach to the Oregon-Nevada border and a village feast where Kyrgyz men butcher livestock and grill him about Amerikadan. Three essays constitute the second half of this thesis. &quot;What Happened Yesterday in Baghdad&quot; recounts the author\\'s conversations with a group of Iraqi students visiting Colorado. Their wartime memories resonate with his life as a public radio producer between 2004 and 2008--a time when he assembled reports for correspondents in Baghdad and helped &quot;voice&quot; the words of the conflict\\'s victims. &quot;Exposure Time&quot; reflects on the author\\'s preoccupation with dying in a cycling accident, which in turn offers an entry into recollections of violence in Cartagena, Colombia, and Osh, Kyrgyzstan. The final essay, &quot;I\\'d Like to Talk About the Bigger Stuff,&quot; explores the author\\'s separation from a woman who observes, after his Peace Corps service, that he no longer has compassion for animals. This observation invites a meditation on American relationships with dogs, cats, and wildlife; the roles of dogs, goats, and horses in Kyrgyzstan; and the legacy of the Soviet Union in Central Asia.

God is always surprising her by speaking through quite different people-- sometimes young and at other times old or in-between, sometimes male and at other times female. This young woman is portrayed as a very ordinary person, but her experiences of God seem to set her apart. If we were to be asked where most consistently we experience God, I doubt that many of us would say that we hear God speaking to us. In fact, we tend to be wary of people who hear \\\\\\\\\\\\\"voices\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or God speaking to them. Yet the God of the Old and New Testaments is a communicator. We identify the scriptures as the word of God. Christian prayer has always been understood as a dialogue, with both God and ourselves speaking and listening to each other. What we are sometimes slow to recog-nize is that God communicates not just in words. In the whole world of creation, God is speaking. Our personal talents, our gifts, our traits tell us that God has loved us personally into existence. People have always found the majesty of God in the surging of the ocean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Review for Religious waves, in the soaring heights of mountain peaks, and in the rosy-fingered morning sun. Certain people coming into our lives make real to us the call, the concern, the compassion of God. Their very presence makes us feel touched by God. We Catholics have always held our saints in great esteem and affection. They continue to touch us with God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence. We remember our dead because they too, strikingly holy or not, have spoken to us of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care. We ask for their help because they relate us to God. And so God speaks to us not only in the sacred words of Scripture, but also through people and things and events of our everyday environment. Modern psychology has made us aware that we com-municate through body language. God, too, uses body language to talk to us. Every time we celebrate Christmas we can \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hear\\\\\\\\\\\\\" what God is saying to us through the baby Jesus. No one is frightened by a baby--seeing no stern judge or a wrathful and punishing monarch. The baby Jesus reaches out and hands himself over to us in great freedom and trust and love. This baby in a manger-- Jesus--is God speaking. The wonder of Christmas brings home to us how, first among all .the other ways of com-municating, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incarnate Word speaks to us. What we need to observe in a more daily way is the silence of a Christmas night so that we can watch and listen. Perhaps that is our New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resolution. David L. Fleming SJ ES. The Review for Religious staff and board mem-bers pray for a holy and blessed Advent and Christmas seasons for all of our readers. 64.4 2005 JAMES A. RAFFERTY Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation praying This reflection looks at the relationship between Mary and the Eucharistic Lord. It attempts to show, in particular, Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intimate presence to the Eucharist. As a woman at the center of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for all humanity, Mary may properly be identified as Woman of the Eucharist, the title both reverential and affectionate that Pope John Paul employs in his encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia. This title is not merely a clever the-ological phrase about Mary symbolizing the entire church by her faith and receptive coop-eration. The title is about Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profound spir-itual relationship with her Son. Attuned as no other to the intimate communion deep within the Trinity, Mary singularly understands Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Eucharistic heart as it embraces all humanity in choosing Calvary, where self-surrendering love is displayed in shocking degree. James A. Rafferty, a priest of the Diocese of Scranton, is chaplain and a campus minister at Marywood University\\\\\", \\\\\"2300 Adams Avenue\\\\\", \\\\\"Scranton, Pennsylvania 18509. Review for Religious More than a theological category or doctrinal for-mulation, Mary, Woman of Eucharist, sings the hymn of one woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surrender to the divine Love that gently invites people to become more like itself. The sacra-mental Eucharist we celebrate today has its peak expres-sion in the Last Supper that opens the original drama of the paschal mystery, but Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Eucharistic offering is not limited to those hours of his life. Rather, his entire being may be described as Eucharist--sacrificial self-offering emboldened by an enormous gratitude. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, too, chants her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic hymn of praise and self-gift long before she accompanies him to the moment when he hands over all that he is on the cross. Eucharistic tones reverberate in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immaculate con-ception, in the annunciation, in her hearing her Son pro-claim the kingdom, in her presence at Calvary, and in her sharing in the Easter glory. The first Eucharistic moment in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, as in everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, is the moment of conception. Like everyone else, Mary receives her unique and unrepeatable iden-tity as nothing other than gift, gift to herself and to the world. Births celebrate the overflowing of love from the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart into time and space, letting itself be known in the life of another. Life itself means receiving what we cannot give or produce on our own. This divine gift is always more splendid than cellular interactions and anatomical functions. The Spirit of God breathing into clay sacramentalizes the loving communion of the Creator with the created. Physical existence, even veiled in the womb, announces the divine creative imagination that renders each life sacred by bearing the image and likeness of the Triune God. While every new human life arouses awe and thank-fulness in the presence of this loving gift from God, the humble daughter of Israel has an unprecedented 343 64.4 2005 Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation God creates Mary as one ready to welcome, grace without resistance, Eucharistic glow from her immaculate conception. The child of Anne and Joachim receives from her first instant the totally unmerited gift of being preserved by God from all stain of original sin. God creates Mary as one ready to welcome grace without resistance. Her very dis-position is to seek always what is the delight of her Creator and Lord. In her immaculate heart Mary bows before the tender stirrings of the Spirit of Yahweh. She never lurches away from the Lord in willful-ness. Her submission to God is like the strings of a peerless violin at the touch of a skilled violinist. The instrument exists precisely to give resonance to the master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s melody and fill the air with music. The violinist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s touch is not subjugation. It frees the instrument to be its fullest self. Mary cooperates wholly in all that God desires for her. We pray during the liturgy for something of her receptivity when we say, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word, and I shall be healed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Although these words originate in Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 encounter with a centurion concerned for his servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health, the litur-gical context may suggest Zacchaeus, delighted to wel-come Jesus to his home and almost happy at not concealing how much his soul has needed tidying up. As we approach the altar to receive the gift of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Body and Blood, it seems that Jesus wishes to evoke within us Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change of heart: first refusing to let Jesus wash his feet and then eagerly conceding at Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 insistence. Again, the Immaculate Conception is a permanent stance of receptivity. We seek that disposition in our own prepa-ration for Communion. Review for Religious The Eucharistic motif appears in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life also in her obscurity and poverty. Her simple, humble existence in a tiny village reflects the Eucharist. There Mary depends utterly on God. Mary experiences a real, not just a romantic, poverty. She feels with all who are poor the realities of hunger, cold, and powerlessness. For her the cry of the poor is not a hypothetical, poetic verse\\\\\", \\\\\"it echoes her authentic abandonment to the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provi-dence in situations where human efforts do not accom-plish much. There is more here than a passive resolve to endure difficulty and want. Mary finds comfort and assur-ance in a faithful God who has pledged never to aban-don the people he has chosen to be his own. As a woman of actual poverty, Mary relates to God as the provider of her daily needs. She carries within her a practiced confi-dence that God attends to her hunger and thirst, a heart-felt trust that breaks into the praise of the Magnificat. She lives out of the consciousness that it is God who feeds, nourishes, and sustains. Her poverty expresses sol-idarity with every child of the Covenant who awaits God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saving action. Such indomitable hope, passed on across centuries, has been planted deep in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic living is evident in the moment when divinity unites with human flesh at her consent, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let it be done to me according to your word.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Lord instituted the sacramental Eucharist for us to con-sume and thereby have the divine life pulsing strongly within us. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\\\\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to the invitation of God fore-shadows our \\\\\\\\\\\\\"amen\\\\\\\\\\\\\" at being offered the Eucharist. Amen here means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yes, I believe it is the Body of Christ, and, yes, I wish to receive it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is implicitly a consent that the Body of Christ broken, offered, received, and consumed may effect a change in us who partake.of it. As believers we surrender before the mystery in a way similar to Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let it be done to me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Like Mary at the annun- 64.4 2005 Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation 346 ciation, in the Eucharist we implicitly desire that the Trinity take over our life so that our identity, fused with Jesus himself, lets itself be guided by God the Father. When the angel appears to Mary with the message that she will conceive and bear a son who will be called Son of the Most High, she perceives the compassion radiating from the heart of God. This radiance accom-panies the self-surrender of the God who comes to dwell in flesh. By the grace of the Holy Spirit, Mary is drawn into God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan, which includes Calvary. In the powerful current of paschal love, she more than anyone else glimpses the yearning of God to heal the rift that sin causes in the relationship between Creator and creature. Every act of God in the salvific economy bears a paschal orientation, and Mary intuits the paschal horizon of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s project. That is, she senses the truth of what she meets in the annunciation--a self-offering Love that knows no limitation. Lacking the vocabulary of Trinitarian theology, Mary nonetheless encounters the Father offering his Son in the power of the Holy Spirit. She experiences deep within her the distinct energies of the Trinitarian per-sons, as if eavesdropping on the dialogue of the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan for her. Mary knows, then, a Father sharing his Son with her, and she knows this contemplatively in the depths of her being. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pregnancy does not begin as a mere procedural accomplishment, as valued posses-sions are handed over to faithful friends for safekeeping. Because the Spirit of God fills her, Mary senses the meaning of this act for the Father. The Father is hand-ing over to her, and through her to all humanity, that which is most precious to him, his beloved Son. Mary knows this with her whole being. She knows, too, the Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active participation in this gift-giving. Before the throne of the Father in heaven, Review for Religious the Son exercises the characteristic obedience that he will manifest in the world even to death. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99sfiat opens the path for the eternal Word to enact his incarnation in space and time. The Son exchanges the omnipotence of divine majesty for confinement in the womb of a young woman. The Second Person of the Trinity assumes human nature in its meekest form and progresses accord-ing to the physiological laws of the human condi-tion. Mary, of course, does not, by virtue of her experience of the annun-ciation, have unrestricted access to the mind of God. She remains thor-oughly finite. Like every other human being, she knows only what she can experience. There pre-cisely do we find the glory in the incarnation, the splendid miracle that Mary is the first to perceive--God revealed in human frailty. Mary is present to the moment when the Son clothes himself in the frailty, dependence, poverty, and even death that mark every human life. The words of consecration so familiar in the Eucharistic Prayer are already subtly present at the annunciation. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"You will conceive and bear a son.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"How can this be?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The power of the Most High will over-shadow you.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is as if all of creation--a suffering world yearning for the healing that it is helpless to achieve on its own--has been imploring the Holy Spirit, in one great wordless epidesis, to fill the virginal womb with life. And God responds by making himself present in history for children and adults to see, hear, and touch--and be Mary is present to the moment when the Son clothes himself in the ~ailty, dependence, poverty, and even death that mark every human life. 347 64.4 200Y Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation touched by. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response is personal and collective. She speaks on behalf of a wounded race. Generation after generation of messianic hope permeates the Jewish faith. In Mary and others like Anna and Simeon, this hope is not merely a passive waiting and watching. More than that, it is an ever intensifying desire, calling upon God fervently and ceaselessly from amid the welter of the human condition. Here is the imploring epiclesis to which the Father answers in the incarnation of his Son.. To this intensification of Jewish prayer may be added the human hearts all over the world humbly defenseless under the weight and the stings of evil. Moved by their sobs and their silence, God intervenes decisively. Through the Holy Spirit and Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yes, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Son becomes present in her womb. This is similar to what occurs in the liturgy. Mary offers herself in conjunction with the cries of a people lost in darkness, and the Holy Spirit completes her offering infinitely by bringing about the presence of Jesus in her womb. The divine love in this human form is Light itself amid earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s darkness. Surrendering himself to the human condition, the Son of God encompasses the human race\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad history in himself. He submits himself to the force of evil that pummels, confuses, and obliterates. At the first moment made possible by Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assent, the world begins to hear the Son whisper, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Take this, all of you, and eat it, this is my body\\\\\", \\\\\"take and drink, this is my blood, given up for you.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mary silently possesses more than an inkling of the self-surrender that God envi-sions. The Son empties himself by taking on human nature, and Mary nourishes humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-sacrificing Savior towards his birth. She and he both anticipate his self-offering on the cross, the offering that rises from burial into resurrection a~l is present each time the Eucharist is celebrated. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praying heart delights in Review for Religious the wonder, adoration, and gratitude with which she accompanies the Child she carries. With maternal love she worships thankfully the Presence within her in a unique Communion. The proclamation of the kingdom of God, too, is redolent of the F~ucharistic. In the Spirit, all grace of whatever form moves human hearts to Communion. People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gifts or fruits of prayer come to naught unless they seek and find some externalization in unity, in Communion. The Spirit is Communio, and all grace drives toward perfect fulfillment in the heavenly ban-quet, the wedding feast of the Lamb, for which the litur-gical sacrifice prepares us. No wonder, then, that the New Testament\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic imagery appears in the ear-liest moments of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 public ministry. At the Jordan, Jesus, who is without sin, does not accept John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s baptism as a gesture of solidarity with weaker brothers and sisters. He is maturely aware of his right relationship with Yahweh. His decision to approach the Baptist, like his acceptance of the cross, manifests publicly the full sur-render to the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will that he has made in prayer many times. Here at the Jordan, Jesus offers himself unreservedly to his Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. He pledges himself to the kingdom that John has heralded. In sublime intimacy the Son prays, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Take this, Father, it is yours.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He hands over to the Father all that he receives: his body, his energy, his desire, his relationships\\\\\", \\\\\"his future. At the Jordan, at the proper time, the Son relives on earth his own unseen choice in eternity to become incarnate. His Father accepts his self-offering and blesses it with the epiphany that confirms the beloved Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity. As Jesus undertakes his public ministry, right from the beginning he gathers a community from people who have little in common other than their friendship with Jesus and the willingness to risk being in his company. 64.4 200~ Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation Mary playsa role in , this formation of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s followers inlto a Eucharistic coinmunityi Jesus does not announce the kingdom as some exhila-rating new ideology or political vision. Rather, he forms relationships and then sees to it that they form rela-tionships with one another. And he gets them sharing in his own relationship, his own communion, with the Father. Today the Eucharistic table is the special place where the Father reaches out to his sons and daughters and where they seek the deep unity among themselves that they find occurs only when God is in their midst. In celebrating the Eucharist, Christians accompany Jesus and attend to his words and actions, and he forms the church in his paschal love just as he did with his first disciples. Mary, Woman of the Eucharist, plays a role in this formation of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s followers into a Eucharistic com-munity. Here this does not mean intuitions of their rit-ual participation in the Mass. Rather, it means learning a new way of being loved by God. Their souls are being awakened to tolerate and then to rejoice that Jesus comes not to be served but to serve. The Spirit is slowly instructing them in the language of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart, which speaks most eloquently in the silence of Good Friday. But, preparing for that day, Jesus brings his friends and coworkers home with him to Nazareth and to Mary. They have left home and livelihood to stay with him. They are good people, but they carry the soot of the world with them. Their hands and their hearts are stained with the grime of laboring in a world pol-luted by greed, prejudice, dishonesty, violence, and cynicism. Review for Religious As if in a retreat in preparation for the work of the kingdom, the disciples notice the warmth of pure love between Jesus and his mother. The home at Nazareth serves as a chapel of adoration, of deep devotion, where the love that the graced human spirit is capable of becomes visible. In Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 relating with Mary, there is no hardness of heart, no defensiveness, no secrecy, no inse-curity. The disciples could not have resisted being affected by the goodness of this mother and this Son. Long before Mary and John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence on Calvary, Jesus is already drawing his friends into Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s universal moth-erhood. At the same time, Mary quietly rejoices as she watches the glow of Trinitarian communion dawn in the lives of others. As the church begins to form, Mary joy-fully waits at the center to share what she has received. Eucharistic nuances continue to pervade Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dis-cipleship of her Son, especially in her loyal, fearless par-ticipation in his death and resurrection. The full meaning of the Via Crucis opens up before people who contem-plate it with Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent to the angel at the annunciation reaches its climax in her yes beneath the cross, where her heart, united with her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, is in perfect obedience to the Father. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obedience is not a horrified resignation to the inevitable, nor a resentful passivity in the face of something she desperately wants to alter. Mary cooperates in the sacrifice of Jesus. Indeed, as Jesus struggles toward the altar of the cross, Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirit accompanies him with the prayer that nothing dis-suade him from his g0al. Whatever dark lies, taunts, or tortuous subtleties the tempter hurled at him in Gethsemane, Mary, in luminous contrast, gently urges him not to give up. Her intense love for Jesus cannot wish him to be other than who he is. In her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s selfless desire to give himself away out of love, amid the hor-rific brutality of Calvary, Mary gazes upon the heart of 64.4 200Y Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation the Trinity revealed in human history. Wondrously graced, she embraces both the incomparable grief of a woman who witnesses her son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s execution and the awe of one who witnesses a compassion as vast as God him-self. Jesus gives forth his last breath, every last spark of energy in his being. For humaniv ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake he surrenders to Mary embraces both the incomparable grief of a woman who Witnesses her son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s execution and the awe of one: who witnesses a compassion as vast as God himself. the Father all that he has and is, and Mary watches the birth of a New Covenant. In her excruciating sorrow there is an unshak-able joy. What can possibly convey the significance of her tears shed that day? Hers are tears of pain and also over-whelming delight at a mystery so profound it takes an eternity to contemplate it. Mary does not impede or resist the cross of her Son. She lives and moves in the Spirit of the Father who hands over his beloved Son. Mary deeply comprehends the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sacrificial love. She is the first human being to understand all that the Eucharistic sacrifice entails. Even more incredible, she prays for everyone to have the courage to approach the sacrifice of Jesus and with her to desire its fulfill-ment in a personal assent to Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 self-offering. The Eucharist derives its meaning and power from Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pas-sion, death, and resurrection. Mary teaches the church how to adore the Lord at the foot of the cross, where blood and water flowed from the Savior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pierced side. Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disciples, even his closest friends, had to learn of Review for Religious the empty tomb before their despair turned to hope, but Mary is deeply consoled even as she cradles Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lifeless body in her arms. The resurrection and Pentecost show the redeeming power of the paschal mystery. So do present-day Eucharists. They do it not simply because Christ died on the cross, but because he lives now and forever, some-thing our faith knows. Through her deep faith Mary is already disposed for Easter before her risen Son ever appears. For the faithful woman who can see more than loss and emptiness at Calvary, there is more than the silence of the grave. There is a confident communion with the Father, whose unwavering love Mary knows well. Her soul has felt the tender power of the Spirit bringing to birth what human imagination cannot fathom. Mary has learned well to trust in more than what her senses reveal. She is the authentic contemplative, familiar with the Spirit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement, and it is not a spirit of despair. She remains a mother in those dark hours. She consoles and encourages the confused, disheartened disciples until the Paraclete fills their hearts with the light of Truth and with Pentecostal fire. Deep faith in the Risen One sees more than any eyes can see. It sees that death itself is not the tragic loss it appears to be, but is the last measure of the prelude to the divine oratorio of eternal life. In the Eucharist, too, participants see and hear more than their senses per-ceive. The bread is no longer bread, the wine no longer wine, but the living presence of Jesus Christ, who makes of his members a living communion. It is Mary who leads the church to the Eucharistic Lord. Hers is no mere external presence or observance or performance. She is intimately involved in her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for the world. Her heart comes to us with the Love that overflows the heart of God. 64.4 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation Sources Pope John Paul II.

Review for Religious ERNEST E. LARKIN From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation T~nPaper is a bit of narrative theology, something y personal journey over the last twenty-five or thirty years trying to practice meditation and contem-plation. My account begins in midstream of my religious life, in the mid 1970s, with my introduction to centering prayer. Basically the journey has been from centering and centering prayer to Christian Meditation, the prayer discipline of John Main (+1982). Three Ways to the Center First, the point of departure. What do I mean by cen-tering and centering prayer? These .terms have become familiar and clearly defined today. It was not always so. Centering and centering prayer meant different things to different people in the 1960s and 1970s. An example is the article by Thomas E. Clarke sJ in the British journal The Way titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Finding Grace at the Centre.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 The title may be familiar, because it named a collection of Ernest E. Larkin OCarm wrote for us last in July-August 2003. His address is St. Agnes Catholic Church\\\\\", \\\\\"1954 North 24th Street\\\\\", \\\\\"Phoenix, Arizona 85008. 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation essays on centering prayer published by the Trappists in 1978 and again by Skylight Paths Publishing in 2002. The whole article was reprinted except for the last two pages, which at the time represented one of the chief contributions of the article. So I have a quarrel with the editors for deleting the pages and not indicating they did so. Apparently they wanted to highlight the one form of centering prayer they were espousing in the booklet, and so dropped two other prayer forms that Clarke was presenting as ways to the center. In the article Clarke presented a philo-sophical exposition of centering and then posed the ques-tion: How does one make the journey to the center? His answer was threefold. The first way was classical center-ing prayer, the way of dark faith, which proceeds beyond images and concepts and seeks to rest in the indwelling God. The other two ways to the center used imagination and feelings\\\\\", \\\\\"they were the prayer of images and fantasy and the practice of the examen of consciousness. All three were ways to the center, ways to dispose the soul for the great gift of contemplation. Together they offered a rich and broadly based prayer life. Teachers of centering prayer should have applauded the connecting of centering prayer with other forms of active prayer. Centering prayer is contemplative in intent, but active in method, as are all forms of meditation. Centering prayer was not supposed to replace lectio div-ina, nor to become one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total prayer life. Centering prayer is a spiritual exercise to deepen one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whole spir-itual life, animating, for example, the liturgy and one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devotions. Connecting the three ways put flesh and blood on centering prayer by acknowledging that imagination and human effort can help in the process of centering. Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paper stated a simple and even obvious fact, Review for Religious namely, that the search for contemplation, especially in beginnings, is not an abstract act\\\\\", \\\\\"it invokes images and thoughts even while it strives to get beyond them. All three ways converge to the center. This was a welcome reminder in the early days of centering prayer. I remember how the insight thrilled me. I talked about the distinctions with Father John Kane, a Redemptorist, who founded a contemplative house of prayer in Tucson, Arizona. We both agreed that the article was a breakthrough because it made room for the imagination at least in the beginnings of con-templative prayer. The search for contemplation was not restricted to forced abstract search\\\\\", \\\\\"one did not have to empty the mind. Centering prayer was one way to contemplation and a good way, but it was not the only way. Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article contextualized the search for contemplation and freed it from a one-track pursuit based on theoretical textbook definitions. Before this time I had a philosophically correct but pastorally deficient understanding of contemplation as imageless prayer. I thought \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ignatian contemplation,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for example, which consists in reliving a gospel story, was a misnomer\\\\\", \\\\\"the process was meditation, not con-templation. I did not cotton to Morton Kelsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis that the imagination ruled the prayer practice in the church in the first millennium, and that abstract con-templation in the mode of John of the Cross was Johnny-come- lately in the second millennium. Kelsey argued this position in his popular The Other Side of Silence. To my mind, contemplation had no room for images\\\\\", \\\\\"they Have we had a philosophically correct but pastorally deficient understanding of contemplation as imageless prayer? 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation belonged to discursive prayer, the way of meditation, which was a lesser species of mental prayer. But here was Tom Clarke connecting the imagination with centering, thereby broadening horizons in contemplative prayer. The three ways of centering were a significant help to me. Two years earlier, in 1975, I had made a thirty-day Ignatian retreat and came away with the resolution to spend an hour each morning in mental prayer. I was faithful to the hour, but I lacked method. My prayer was amorphous. I read and reflected, I pondered, mused, stirred affections, and made resolutions. I also centered and sat for long periods of silence. But there was no particular order in my pondering. After two years of struggle to be faithful to the hour without a clear methodology, my prayer had became dry and difficult. I \\\\\\\\\\\\\"white-knuckled\\\\\\\\\\\\\" my prayer, holding on to the bench to fill out the hour. All this may have been a species of the determinada determinacion of Teresa of Avila, but it was probably closer to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"zelus sine scientia corruit\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of St. Bernard: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Zeal without knowledge destroys.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" How long could I hold on? Only the grace of God kept me from giving up on the hour. My efforts in the hour were the same as my practice in the two daily periods of formal meditation in my Carmelite community over the years. These two peri-ods were shorter, usually a half hour each, and I was able to handle them, though somewhat haphazardly. Because they were amorphous, I subsequently looked on them disparagingly. I thought I had wasted a lot of time in my mental prayer. I do not think that way now. I have come to take a more benign view. I realize with Woody Allen that ninety-five percent of life as well as of prayer is showing up. If we are there, putting in time with the Lord, the Lord will do the rest. We should not exag-gerate the role of method. Review for Retigious But method helps. The three ways of Tom Clarke supplied a format for my contemplative prayer. I would do twenty minutes of classical centering prayer, twenty minutes of reflection on the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s readings, and then after Mass twenty minutes ofjournaling. I did not char-acterize the imaginative parts of my prayer--the biblical meditation and consciousness examen--as contempla-tive, but I saw them as part of my pursuit of contempla-tion. Moreover, the active prayers gave permission for elements of imagination to enter my centering prayer. At this time I made a study of the prayer of St. Teresa of Avila in her early premystical years to determine how she employed the imagination in her beginning con-templative prayer.2 She later called this \\\\\\\\\\\\\"practice of prayer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" active recollection. In the paper I argued that the imagination played a significant role in her practice. Her prayer was her own making, hence active in form\\\\\", \\\\\"but it was contemplative since her whole effort was to rest in the deep personal realization of the Divine Indwelling. This was her whole prayer. Teresa called it \\\\\\\\\\\\\"re-presenting Christ within.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Commentators sometimes incorrectly interpret this phrase to mean the imagina-tive recall of some mystery in Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, such as of his being scourged at the pillar. The imaginative recall is part of the prayer, but not its heart, since the recall is only the refocusing of the person in moments of wan-dering. The remembrance of an image from the passion serves the same function as the holy word in centering prayer. The holy word does not detract from the con-templative character of centering prayer any more than the image in active recollection. I concluded my paper on Teresa by saying that her prayer was a mixture of imageless and imaged centering prayer. Today I agree that the term centering prayer should be reserved to the prayer of imageless dark faith. 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 3,60 This primary thrust, however, leaves room for some imagination in the practice of this prayer. Teresa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active recollection, which can rightly be called centering prayer, was both apophatic, that is, beyond imagining and thinking, and kataphatic, that is, with a role for the imagination. These insights into Teresa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer confirmed Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion and allowed me to accept a minor but real role for the imag-ination in my own practice and theorizing about con-templative prayer. As late as the year 2000, I was still experimenting with a role for the imagination in my contemplative prayer. I was on another long retreat at the Camaldolese monastery at Big Sur in California. For five weeks I prac-ticed Christian Meditation several times each day. I described three different experiences of my contempla-tive prayer in an article in Review for Religious in 2001.3 Two of the patterns I reported engaged the imagination to a small extent. These points about the imagination and contemplation are not irrelevant\\\\\", \\\\\"they continue to occupy the attention of writers.4 The Move to Christian Meditation The centering and centering prayer so far described were the focus of my efforts at daily mental prayer for some fifteen years. I did not, however, practice it twice daily as was specified by Contemplative Outreach under the leadership of Thomas Keating. The two periods of twenty to thirty minutes, morning and evening, are essential for the discipline of centering prayer. These periods are catalysts for one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer life. They are like workouts in a physical-health regimen, and their role is to bring one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to a deeper level in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirit. The outcome is the goal of contemplation in Carmelite terminology. Review for Religious In the mid 1990s I switched my prayer practice to Christian Meditation, a similar but different form of cen-tering developed by John Main, an Irish Benedictine from England. I did so mainly because I was not satisfied with my practice of classical centering prayer. Christian Meditation is promoted by the World Community for Christian Meditation, headed by Laurence Freeman OSB. The major difference between centering prayer and Christian Meditation is the holy word versus the mantra. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Holy word\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"mantra\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not synonyms. Their dif-ference specifies the two forms of contemplative prayer. Christian Meditation repeats the mantra, usually the biblical prayer \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ma-ra-na-tha,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Come, Lord,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the begin-ning to the end of the prayer. The holy word, on the other hand, is not repeated continu-ously, but only as needed to renew the consent to the Divine Presence. The holy word expresses the will of the person to rest quietly, silently, in the Lord. The mantra, on the other hand, carries the prayer. John Main does not tire of saying that the mantra is the prayer. It creates the silence that is emptiness and open-ness before God, the silence that invites the Divine Presence. The mantra nurtures the beatitude \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Mt 5:8). Purity of heart and contemplation are the two hinges of the door of the mantra. The mantra is not magic, but a simple device to shut down ordinary rational activity in favor of silence. How would we explain the major difference between centering prayer and Christian Meditation as the holy word versus the mantra? 361 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 362 Since I switched my daily practice to Christian Meditation ten years ago, I have been faithful to the two times each day. My personal preference for Christian Meditation is not a condemnation of centering prayer\\\\\", \\\\\"the same fruits and benefits are available in both forms. The choice of one or other of the two disciplines is a personal matter. I feel that centering prayer has a closer affinity with Teresa of Avila than with John of the Cross and that Christian Meditation has a closer affinity with John than with Teresa. I base these opinions on the sim-ilarity between active recollection and centering prayer, and a similarity of absolutes between the nada and the todo in John and the call to kenosis or self-emptying in Christian Meditation. In the final analysis the two approaches are more alike than different. For this reason I have studied them together and emphasized what is common to them. I have published several articles on the two forms, which I hope to gather into a book. The leaders in the two movements work closely together and see their ministries as parallel. One example of this close collaboration is a prayer center in Phoenix called the Cornerstone. It is sponsored by both movements, which share the same space in a former convent in the Carmelite parish of St. Agnes. The Cornerstone offers programs that are sometimes common to both groups and sometimes specific to one of them. It is lay orga-nized and lay directed. The Genius of Christian Meditation I have come to see Christian Meditation as a com-panion piece, a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"how to\\\\\\\\\\\\\" addition to the teaching of St. John of the Cross on the passage from meditation to contemplation. This area is one of his specialties. He defines in precise terms both meditation and contem-plation and why the transition from one state to the other Review for Religious can be difficult if not traumatic. Meditation for him is a rational activity, the work of the imagination and the discursive reason\\\\\", \\\\\"it is active and self-directed. Contemplation is passive and receptive of the gift of the love and presence of God. The transition from one state to the other can be disturbing. Beginning contempla-tion may look like a step backward, even total loss. The old way of meditation is no longer appealing or even possible, and the new way of contemplation is not self-evident. The experience is the passive dark night of the senses. It is a great grace, but easily mistaken and open to misunderstanding. John gives his famous three signs to authenticate the state as well as detailed instruction on the conduct to be followed. In discursive meditation one deals with concrete indi-vidual acts, striving to remove the bad ones and to pro-mote good ones. So meditation is analyzing, evaluating, making choices and resolutions. The soul is like a win-dowpane, St. John says, and the work of meditation is to remove the smudges of bad habits and replace them with acts and habits that are bright with the light of Christ. The light of Christ is faith. The window pane is lighted up by faith-motivated activity. Over time the win-dow becomes clear and the soul purified in the matter of concrete choices. The light of faith shines through with fullness, simplicity, and wholeness. This is the light of contemplation. The light is always there, John of the Cross says. It is part of the state of grace. The perception of the light, however, is dependent on being rid of delib-erate sinful habits. John writes as follows: This light is never lacking to the soul, but, because of creature forms and veils that weigh on it and cover it, the light is never infused. If individuals would elimi-nate these impediments and veils and live in pure nakedness and poverty of spirit, as we will explain 64.4 200~ Larkin * From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 364 later, their soul in its simplicity and purity would be immediately transformed into simple and pure Wisdom, the Son of God. (Ascent 2.15.4) Thus these graces, when received, are \\\\\\\\\\\\\"infused light and love,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that is, infused contemplation. The way of con-templation is self-awareness of this new state of being. One simply opens one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes and sees and basks in the love and presence of God. At first there will be a going back and forth between meditation and contemplation. John of the Cross gives detailed advice on how to recognize the times for the one or the other, that is, when to continue to meditate and when to rest in the contemplative light and love. His teaching is renowned for its clarity and effectiveness for spiritual direction and retains its place in the life of every budding contemplative. But it is a complicated teaching. Along comes John Main who sees meditation and contemplation in conti-nuity with each other and as one process. The prayer or discipline of Christian Meditation is one dynamic that begins with the mantra and stays with it through multi-ple experiences of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love. Contemplation is the awareness of Abba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for me, who am bonded with the Son in the love of the Holy Spirit. The contemplative grows in the appreciation of this love and gets ever more deeply in touch with the knowledge and love that the Tr!nity showers on the world. There is communio, koinonia, participation in the reality of God and his cre-ation. This communion is unitive knowledge, of subject and subject inhering in each other. It is not dualistic knowledge, from the outside, leaving subject and object apart from one another. It is not any particular psycho-logical experience. There is at-oneness, a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"common union\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or communion, in which the Trinity and the human being enter into what Teresa of Avila called Review for Religious union, namely, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"two things becoming one.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Communion is the ontological reality\\\\\", \\\\\"contemplation adds awareness and attention. Not every experience of Christian Meditation is infused contemplation such as John of the Cross has in mind. But every experience is communion and eventually will bring the fullness of contemplation. The commitment to Christian Meditation is a com-mitment to a way of life. The way is always the same\\\\\", \\\\\"it is the way of the mantra from beginning to end. The goal of the prayer is without limits. One stops saying the mantra only when one is reduced to silence. These are moments of special grace that John of the Cross calls \\\\\\\\\\\\\"oblivion\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Living Flame 3.3 5). One resumes saying the mantra as soon as the silence is recognized, because that is the sign that the special mystical grace has passed. John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program is one of utter simplicity. He does not stress, though he may acknowledge in theory, the abstract differences between meditation and con-templation or the different degrees of contemplation. But he treats them as one spiritual practice and says explicitly that meditation, meditative prayer, contem-plation, and contemplative prayer are all synonyms. No need to be concerned about essences, he seems to say\\\\\", \\\\\"the important thing is to grow in purity of heart and recep-tivity to divine grace. The journey is the same in both John of the Cross and John Main, but it is described from different viewpoints. The older John presents objective theology in the manner of the scholastics\\\\\", \\\\\"the younger John has made the turn to the subject, and his exposition is experiential and practical. Laurence Freeman remarks that John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose was to start people on the journey and let experience of the prayer teach the rest. The one task proposed is the mantra. The mantra does not deal with obstacles one by one or even supply building blocks for a spiritual edi- 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 566 rice. It silences the mind, emptying it of its contents. The silence makes room for the Spirit to take over. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Be,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" says John Main,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and you are in the Spirit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\"s The Spirit is already there with Father and Son in the Divine Indwelling. If the soul is silent and receptive, the Spirit will pray there beyond images and thoughts, in sighs too deep for words (Rm 8:26). The Spirit will do this because the soul is open and ready and God wants that mutual indwelling even more than the soul does who is sincerely seeking God. John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple method frees the person so that the presence of the Trinity can come alive and be actualized. When there is space and freedom, the meditator is caught up in the prayer of Jesus. That prayer is the one and only prayer in the world since the Incarnation, because it is the love between Father and Son and envelops all of creation. Faithful meditators are woven into that salvit]c love. The journey with the Son to the Father will traverse the stages of Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Christian Meditation will be the vehicle, the discipline to get one going and to help one stay on the path. These are astounding claims for Christian Meditation. Their jus-tification is the beatitude \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Mt 5:8). The silence of the mantra produces the purity of heart, and the reward of purity of heart is the love of God, of people, and of the world found in the gift of contemplation. How does silence accomplish this twofold task? By allowing one to escape from the false self by placing one beyond the toils of ego and the world it creates, by free-ing one from the imprisonment of false desires. This healing produces purity of heart. The new freedom allows one to go deeper into the spirit, the domain of the Trinity. The reality of this state is primary and comes before awareness and appreciation. The reality is called Review for Religious communio or participation in the life of God\\\\\", \\\\\"the aware-ness is contemplation. The Spirit will give us contem-plation when we are ready. Contemplation is thus the outcome of faithful prac-tice of the mantra. Contemplation is the life of God received, the backdrop and engine of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whole spiri-tual life. It is the life that animates one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community rela-tionships, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ministry, and one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer. The short definition is the realization of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for us, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the love of God poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given us\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Rm 5:5). Contemplation is the outcome of a faithful life. It means claiming what was there from the beginning. It is the Abba experience of Jesus. In his human life Jesus was filled with the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and love. Certain events like the baptism or the transfiguration were climactic experiences of that love, but Jesus abided in that love always. He looked out upon the world bathed in the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love. He was the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"beloved Son,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and in him the reign of God was estab-lished on the earth. That reign is the kingdom of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and love. It is the resurrection experience. It fills the world with the grandeur of God. Christian Meditation promises this contemplation. Each practice will not necessarily bring forth a recog-nizable, reflexive experience of that love. But every exer-cise will put one a little more in touch with it and will be an experience of communion, of koinonia, of participation in that love. Transformation is taking place, slowly, incre-mentally, and the Christian is being formed in the Wisdom of God, the Son of God, in whom we live and move and have our being. Christian Meditation can indeed be one practical response of meditation and con-templation in our troubled times. 64.4 200Y Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation Notes 1 Way 17 (1977): 12-22. 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Teresa of Avila and Centering Prayer,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Carmelite Studies 3 (Washington, D.C.: ICS Publications, 1984), pp. 203-209. 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"An Experience of Christian Meditation,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Review for Religious 60 (2001): 419-431. 4 See, for example, Brian V.

SAMMON Rekindling the Fire: Vocation Efforts Dear Brothers and all who cherish the charism of Marcellin Champagnat, It is early morning here in Rome. The last guests from Saturday evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vigil celebration of the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feast have departed, the house is quiet, and the first hours of a new day are just beginning to unfold. What better time than the dawn of St. Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day to begin a letter to you about the awakening of vocations to his Little Brothers of Mary. Please join me in this continuing effort, this continuing prayer. Like so many of you, I believe that God continues to move the hearts of young people and call them to a variety of voca-tions within our church. So let us pledge to do our best to foster their generous response, while concentrating our efforts on those called to our way of life and mission as Little Brothers of Mary. After all, our Marist Constitutions and Sefin D. Sammon FMS, superior general of the Marist Brothers, writes again in epistolary form. His address is Fratelli Maristi delle Scuole\\\\\", \\\\\"C.P. 10250\\\\\", \\\\\"00144 Roma, Italy. calling 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire Statutes reminds us that to do so is a sign of our vitality as an institute. 3:70 Awakening Vocations Well-designed publications, attractive posters, lively and thoughtful presentations that deal with our life and ministry are all ways of cultivating vocations. They all help young people, their parents, and our church to have a better sense of who we are and what we do, and espe-cially to learn something about what we cherish and hold dear. When all is said and done, however, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it actually the lives of thousands of brothers over the almost two-hundred- year history of our institute that are our most effective means to awaken vocations? And so your voca-tional tale and mine are good places to start if we want to understand more fully just what we are trying to do. It does no harm to ask ourselves from time to time what first brought us to the life of a Little Brother of Mary and what keeps us here. My own story began when I met the small group of brothers who staffed the high school I attended in the heart of New York City. Even with the distance of years, I can still remember what it was about those men that captured my imagination and my heart. They were obvi-ously religious people, and they appeared happy in their work together and in their commitment to it. There was a spirit of sacrifice among them that somehow appealed to my adolescent soul. And there was passion. This element is at the heart of any vocation worth its salt. Though I may not have rec-ognized it at the time, I realize now that there were some very passionate men in that small group of brothers. In retrospect I can see that, in their love for Jesus Christ and his Good News and for us their students, they shared with us some of the very qualities that our founder Review for Religious inspired in the young men we know today as Francois, Laurent, Jean-Baptiste, Dominique, and Louis-Marie. Even now I find myself surprised at how subtly God was at work in my life, though I surely would never have used that language when I was fourteen. I have to say that I was blessed early in life to meet those men who took delight in helping a rather uncivi-lized crowd of young men to grow up and grow closer to God. These men--many were young themselves--were willing to waste time on us. Time, it was their only currency, and they shared it with us freely and gen-erously. During the years since then, perhaps in imitation or through the mystery of grace, some of my happiest moments have been with young people, sharing their world, their hopes and dreams, their fears and concerns, their ques-tions of faith. Vocation promotion :should neVer be undertaken solely for survival. Vocations for Mission and Not Survival Vocation promotion should never be .undertaken solely for survival. Nor is it simply a matter of numbers. Numbers are not necessarily a sign of viability, nor is age the best measure of vitality. Our zeal for mission, then, rather than a desire to survive \\\\\\\\\\\\\"come what may,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" must be our reason for awakening vocations. This tradition goes back to Father Champagnat. The ever unfolding tale of our institute records that Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit to the bedside of a dying teenager is what persuaded him to found a com-munity of brothers with this aim: to proclaim God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News to poor children and young people. We know the story well. Discovering that Jean-Baptiste Mongagne knew \\xc2\\xaf \\\\\\\\\\\\\" 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire nothing about his faith, Marcellin instructed him, admin-istered what were then called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the last sacraments,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and went on his way. Returning a short while later, he dis-covered that the lad had died. I have often wondered about our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts and feelings as he returned home to Lavalla that evening. We can imagine his pace quickening. We know that almost immediately upon his arrival he met Jean-Marie Granjon, who had been a grenadier in Napoleon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army. Picture their conversation taking place on the bridge near what today is the Hermitage. For Marcellin the mission was clear, the reasons for founding a commu-nity of brothers evident. As they talked on that bridge, our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion convinced the former soldier to join him and give his heart to a corporate adventure soon to be known as the Little Brothers of Mary. Marcellin loved the children and young people of his day. More than once he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"l cannot see children with-out wanting to tell them how much Jesus Christ loves them, and how much I love them.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world many children and young people are the victims of war, human trafficking, and the streets. Denied an education and other basic human rights, they are in desperate need of hearing God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News. And so, I ask you, do you believe as I do that the mission of our institute is as urgent today as it was in Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day, and that it will remain so for the foreseeable future? If you do, then let us agree that the awakening of new vocations can no longer be a sideline attraction for you or for me. Instead, we need to develop a plan for promoting vocations and then put that plan into action. A First Set of Challenges A few challenges before we go on. First, a challenge to my brothers in the institute. If you and I want to make Review for Religious vocation promotion a top priority, most if not all of us will need to arrange our other commitments so as to free up twenty percent of our best time for that work. Why twenty percent? Because there is a lot to learn and a great deal of work to be done. We can all beg off, citing good reasons not to get involved. Lack of time, the demands of ministry, age--who among us has not heard that litany before? But, if you and I want a future for the mission and life of our institute, we need to avoid making excuses and, instead, commit ourselves enthusi-astically to promoting vocations. And now a word to my lay partners. I ask you to join us in our efforts to educate parents, the young people in your care and ours, and the church at large about who we Little Brothers of Mary are, what our life is, and what our ministries are. You know us and know what we cher-ish and hold dear. Help others come to know us as you do. And help us, too, by inviting young people to con-sider making our way of life their own. I have no hesi-tation in asking you to give these efforts top priority. All who share our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism should eagerly promote vocations to the brotherhood he established. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News remains to be proclaimed to more children and young people than we might imagine. And what happens if all of us--brothers and lay part-ners alike--decide not to make vocation promotion a major concern and not to give enough time to this impor-tant ministry? What are the consequences? Some would say that a failure to act and act decisively would dimin-ish the probability of a vital and vibrant future for our way of life and ministry. Others would be harsher. If we fail to act, they would tell us, we probably do not deserve a future. In 1822 Marcellin Champagnat faced a vocation cri-sis, the first in the history of our institute. And how did 373 64.4 200~ Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire he respond? By taking action, beginning with his pil-grimage to the chapel of Our Lady of Pity. We do well today to follow his example. Today more than a few peo-ple use the term vocation culture to describe an environ-ment in which a call or vocation can take root and flourish. You and I can foster such a culture by believing that vocations to Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Little Brothers of Mary exist today and that with God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace and our human efforts we can find and cultivate them. A Pastoral Plan for Awakening Vocations A pastoral plan to awaken vocations can help us awaken vocations to our way of life and ministry. A num-ber of provinces and districts already have a well- A ,pastoral: p!an to awaken vocations can help Us awaken, vocations to our way of life and ministry: designed plan in place. Time will tell of its effec-tiveness. Other provinces and districts can take time or make time to develop a plan. The plan should be comprehensive and include in its details the province or district, all the mem-bers, each community, and every ministry--and, of course, all the others who share Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism and want to help promote vocations. In drawing up any plan, you and I are better off con-centrating on what can be done rather than lamenting things we cannot change. In some parts of the world, for example, families are smaller than in the past, young people have far more vocational options to consider, and they may make their life commitments at a later age. Neither you nor I can do much to alter these realities. We can, though, invite young men to our way of life and ministry once again, and we can open our homes and Review for Religious hearts to them. We can also help them and others to understand all that has happened in religious life and in our institute during the forty years since Vatican Council II. Let us do what we can, and not keep wringing our hands about what we cannot change. In making plans we must be sure they are adapted to the culture in which we live. A universal pastoral plan for vocations is unrealistic. Differences exist between regions, and customs vary. What is quite acceptable in one part of our world is looked upon with suspicion in another. And so I offer below just a few ideas to get your thinking started. Be as creative as you can. And do not forget to include in the plan exactly whatyou plan to do personally. a. Province or District Provinces and districts should have at least one full-time vocation promoter, but everyone should promote vocations. The full-time promoter should help the oth-ers to do what they can. There should be a well-designed program that explains contemporary religious life to lay men and women. Some of our brothers will tell you that they feel shaken by the changes in our way of life during the last four decades. In that case, just imagine how shaken the average Catholic may be. In some countries, for example, people feel betrayed and confused about why we no longer staff the local school and do not live in the brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house next to the church. A good program could clarify the reasons behind such changes. It could also show that everyone--the laity, bishops and priests, and men and women religious themselves--has a respon-sibility for recruiting new members for religious con-gregations. Some among these groups appear reluctant to do so. I cannot help believing that such reluctance may stem from a lack of understanding about our life today. Catholic parents deserve special attention. At one 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire 376[ time they were great allies of ours in awakening voca-tions. Today many parents are confused about religious life, about why and how people are still living it. Where their trust has been eroded, we must work to restore it and enlist their aid once again. Our program could include offering an adult educa-tioncourse in a local parish, or as in-service training for faculties in our schools, or as part of parent-teacher con-ferences, or as an Advent or Lenten series. Some could write articles for their parish bulletin or diocesan news-paper. Others could say a few words during or at the end of Mass on Sunday. The means are not quite as impor-tant as the message: our life and mission as brothers is alive and well and ready to receive new members. The work described above could be coordinated by the full-time province vocation promoter. He should not, however, take on these tasks for a local community sim-ply because its members do not want to. His time is bet-ter spent persuading them that the tasks mentioned are rightly theirs and that they have the resources to accom-plish them. Finally, the media and the internet, where avai]able, have great potential to awaken vocations. Where a province web page exists, the vocation pro-moter should make sure that the topic of vocations appears on it and is effectively presented. b. Local Communities Local communities have many opportunities to pro-mote vocations. First of all, though, they should as a group agree to a common plan that ensures that their work will be effective and that nothing will be uselessly duplicated. Prayer must be part of any community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. Along with this, three or four times a year a community might invite groups of young people from their school or parish to an open house that is focused on religious life. Such a visit, particularly if it is well planned, can com- Review for Religious municate more about religious life than a series of lec-tures would. Another community might invite parishioners of all ages for a time of prayer, some refreshments, and some friendly conversation, particularly about religious voca-tions. Many people are willing and ready to participate and help, but they need to be asked. A brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involve-ment in a parish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s youth ministry program can be the occasion for young people to learn more about broth-ers and their life. Lay people involved in youth ministry, especially if they know us well, can also raise the topic or answer questions the young may have about religious life. A community might also arrange to print a pamphlet describing our life and mission and place it in the vestibule of the local parish church. In places where the local newspaper or television station does human-inter-est pieces, one or two members of the community could commit themselves to write an article or be interviewed about our life and ministry. c. Our Works Visibility! That should be the yardstick for measur-ing efforts to promote vocations in the institutions where we serve. Posters, pamphlets, days set aside to present the history, life, and mission of the Little Brothers of Mary--all these should be regular fare in any school or social-service project in which we are involved. Our col-leagues and those whom we serve should know clearly just what it means to be one of Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brothers. While being happily aware that our schools, parishes, and agencies touch others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives well beyond themselves, we must not overlook those with whom we share min-istry. There may, for example, be lay faculty members in our schools who have given thought, to religious life and our life in particular, but just do not know how to [377 64.4 200Y Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire 378 bring up the subject. We should make sure that oppor-tunities exist to discuss the matter, and that they exist in abundance. d. Each Brother and Lay Partner If you asked me to suggest one thing that you as indi-viduals could do to promote vocations, I would answer immediately: Invite young men that you know to think about making our life and ministry their own. Such an invitation by a brother is the factor mentioned most often by young persons and by those further along in years as well. So I say to my brothers: Awaken vocations, find persons who in good time can replace yourselves. And to my lay partners I say: Awaken vocations so as to ensure a vibrant partnership between brothers and yourselves. Without enough brothers, partnership with you is not possible. To all, I offer this reminder: Personal prayer is most important. So pray for those who have religious life on their minds. Pray for them daily. Pray for them by name. If writing is your gift, put it to good use by writing about our life and mission. And if music, or art, or the media world is your passion, use it to awaken vocations. Teach about our life if teaching is your talent\\\\\", \\\\\"encourage vocations if your gift is to motivate people. Above all, be creative in planning to awaken vocations. Keep asking yourselves how to use your God-given skills to promote vocations. Give twenty percent of your best time to the effort, and do not forget to invite. Blessings and affection, Se~in D.

HERIOT Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth 380[ Jr~hn Paul II\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apostolic exhortation on religious life minded us religious of our founders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 charisms and what they offer to us, their followers: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Consecrated per-sons live Jbr God and from God, and precisely for this reason they are able to bear witness to the reconciling power of grace, which overcomes the divisive tenden-cies present in the human heart and in society\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Vita con-secrata 41). And in the same vein we have words that mean much to persons consecrated to a mission: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the image of Jesus, the beloved Son \\xe2\\x80\\x99whom the Father con-secrated and sent into the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 those whom God calls to follow him are also consecrated and sent into the world to imitate his example and to continue his mis-sion\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (VC 72). The young John Bosco, the son of Francis and Margherita Bosco of Becchi in Turin, had a unique expe-rience at the age of nine, and we can think his mission Leo J. Heriot SDB lectures in Salesian history and also teaches pas-toral psychology and Scripture in Moamoa Theological College\\\\\", \\\\\"P.O. Box 9226\\\\\", \\\\\"Apia, Western Samoa. Review for Religious took root at this very time. He had a strange but com-pelling dream, and this dream would return to him often and remind him of this mission of his. Each vocation is unique, and each calling is special, but for God to call a boy of nine and show him his mission in symbolic form is very special. He told about his dream in his own terms, couched in his own plain language, but it seems that the Lord was surely present in it: When I was about nine years old I had a dream that left a profound impression on me for the rest of my life. I dreamed that I was near my home, in a very large playing field where a crowd of children were having fun. Some were laughing, some playing, and not a few cursing. I was so shocked at their language that I jumped into their midst, swinging wildly with my arms and shouting at them to stop. At that moment a man appeared, nobly dressed, with an imposing appearance. He was dressed in white, and his face radi-ated such light that I could not look directly at him. He called me by name. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"John,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"you will have to win over these boys of yours not with punches, but with gentleness and kindness. So now begin to show them that sin is ugly and virtue is attractive.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At this stage John said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am still only a boy. How can I influence these children for the better?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But the man of his dream told him that he was to change these boys by acquiring knowledg~ and being obedient to the Lord. As the young John watched, he saw these boys change into goats, dogs, cats, bears, and a variety of other animals. The person of his dream told him, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is your field where you must work, and to carry out your task you must become humble, steadfast, and strong!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As he looked again, he saw these wild animals change into lambs. In his confusion John Bosco asked the majestic lady who appeared next to him to explain the meaning of this strange thing in his life. She told him, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"In time 381 64.4 200~ Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth When he was ordained a priest on 5 June 1841, he wondered what his future work would be. 382 everything will be made clear to you, and you will under-stand your apostolate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The next morning during breakfast John told his dream. His brothers scoffed at his simplicity, and every-one, including his mother and grandmother, had differ-ent explanations for this dream. Joseph, his older brother, said he would become a sheep farmer, and Anthony, his step-brother, told him he would probably become the leader of gang of robbers. His mother suggested that he might become a priest, and his wise old grandmother told him not to take any notice of dreams!. This dream when he was nine influenced John Bosco all his life. His apostolate and his system of education would be based on the reflections of this dream. When he was ordained a priest on 5 June 1841, with little or no fuss about the ordination, he wondered what his future work would be and how he was supposed to achieve the mission planned for him when he was a little boy. He was offered one or another parish or chaplaincy in Turin. Uncertain of his choice, he went to his spiritual director, Father Joseph Cafasso, and placed before him the various proposals. Strange as it may seem, his guide told him to go to the Convitto Ecdesiastico, a residential center where priests studied spirituality and moral the-ology according to the teaching of St. Alphonsus Liguori. It was not an academic institute so much as a pastoral center w.here a lecture was given morning and evening and the rest of the day was taken up with priestly min-istrations to people in prison, to families in their neigh-borhoods, and to patients in hospitals, especially the Review for Religious hospice founded by Canon Cottolengo (now St. Joseph Benedict Cottolengo). Later on, Don Bosco would write about his experience in this clerical convitto: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Here I learned what it means to be a priest.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Turin in the 1840s was a town filled with young per-sons looking for work. There had been a drought for a number of years, and poverty in the villages had forced many boys and young men into the town seeking employment. Employment was limited, and before long many of them were stealing food or money to survive. They were coming from Lombardy, Savoy, and as far away as Switzerland. Needless to say, with the influx of these young men, the prisons became full. In Turin there were four main prisons, and they were crowded with boys from thirteen to eighteen. Their crimes were more from necessity than malice. Don Bosco made it a point to visit these prisons, tak-ing with him bread, sweets, and tobacco. The conditions were appalling: overcrowded, unsanitary. Loudmouths and foulmouths aired their hatred when these priests came to visit. Many priests from the Convitto Ecclesiastico found it hard to visit the prisoners living in such sub-standard conditions. One described the boys in prison as caged animals, often aggressive and impervious to the kindness of friendship. In his first visit to the prison, where the juveniles were mixed together with the hard-ened men, Don Bosco was treated with disdain. Just after Easter in 1842, however, he invited some prisoners to make a retreat. His friendly concern was slowly seeping into the hearts of the detainees. Some came around, but the going remained difficult. Still, he persevered with his plans, even with the comings and goings. Boys in one prison might be released all of a sudden, perhaps only to be apprehended again and given a sentence in another prison. 383 64.4 2005 Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth 384] The success of this retreat becomes evident in what Don Bosco managed to obtain for the boys. After the retreat he asked the official in charge, Urban Rattazzi, whether he could take the prison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s juveniles to Stupingi for a picnic. Rattazzi agreed, provided that some police-men went along. Don Bosco bargained with him for another arrangement, no policemen. At eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, .:when the prison gates opened, the guards said to one another, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Well, this is the last we will see of some of these 260 wretches!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But, at the roll call at the end of the day, all had returned--showing that a little bit of kindness brings out the best in the worst of children. Another of Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apostolates was in the neigh-borhoods of Turin. Industries were growing there, and on the building sites boys as young as ten or twelve were often seen lugging heavy loads of bricks and mortar on poorly erected scaffolding. Don Bosco would argue with the contractors, appealing for the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 safety. When he first went to the building sites, he would hear the boys sneering and snickering as he passed: Ecco lo prete, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Look at the [good~for-nothing] churchman!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He would reply, No, un sacerdote, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"No, a priest [who sacrifices and blesses].\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He would invite these young boys to his house on Sunday, and many would come for the meal and the instruction he offered them. As a matter of fact, many of these boys became his first Salesians. Don Bosco had enormous persuasive power with the young. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third apostolate in these early years of his priesthood was in Canon Cottolengo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hospice, the Little House of Divine Providence. True love was found there. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special interest was in the section dedicated to the young. Many young persons coming from villages had become the victims of syphilis and gon-orrhea. As a result of these sexually transmitted diseases, young sufferers often finished their lives in this hospice. Review for Religious Don Bosco would often put his head in his hands and say in humble prayer, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"What can I do to help these young people avoid these diseases that are symptoms of a loose society?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" One wonders whether the spirit that in the 19th cen-tury motivated St. John Bosco--founder of the Salesians and, as Pope John Paul II called him, the Father and Teacher of Youth--can be found once again in a world that seems to have forgotten the importance of heart for educating hearts. Education without love is incomplete and can only end in frustration. Compensation Foliage fallen from its color\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weight leaves emptiness in the treetops.

He was the first Catholic to be elected president. The USSR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nikita Khrushchev had already been on the cover of Time maga-zine holding Sputnik, the first successful unmanned spacecraft. Vatican Council II had completed its first session, but no documents had yet been issued. The city of Berlin in what was East Germany was divided by a massive and formidable wall that could be breached only at the risk of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. The French had recently withdrawn from Vietnam, and some of my high school classmates had already fled to Canada to avoid the military draft as American involve-ment in that war began to escalate. JFK had already experienced the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and Elizabeth McDonough OP, our Canonical Counsel colum-nist, has written a number of articles for us. She holds the Bishop Griffin Chair of Canon Law at the Pontifical College Josephinum\\\\\", \\\\\"7625 North High Street\\\\\", \\\\\"Columbus, Ohio 43235. Revie\\xe2\\x80\\x99w for Religious the Cuban missile crisis had been concluded without a nuclear war. Martin Luther King Jr. had very recendy delivered his now famous \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have a Dream\\\\\\\\\\\\\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial. Elvis Presley had appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, the Beatles had finished their first frenzied foray into the USA, and Betty Friedan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Feminine Mystique had iust been published. Within ten weeks of my entering the convent, our nearly one hundred postulants and novices were at choir practice early on a Friday afternoon in November when we heard that JFK had been critically wounded in an assassination attempt in Dallas. We said a prayer and continued singing, unaware that he was already dead. Of the thirty-four postulants who entered the same time I did, twenty-two received the habit almost a year later. No one seemed to think it unusual that so many of the postulants who had entered nearly a year before had now departed. By the time Vatican Council II had concluded in December 1965, Malcolm X had been gunned down, and the Watts riots in Los Angeles were a matter of history. Less than two and a half years later, Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis. Riots immediately left burnt-out buildings, mounds of rubble, and shattered lives in much of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital as well as in other major cities across the country. Two months after that, in June 1968, Robert Kennedy was assassinated while cam-paigning in Los Angeles. Later that summer, antiwar riots disrupted the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. That same year, Mary Daly of Boston College published The Church and the Second Sex, and Richard Nixon, who had lost the election to JFK in 1960, became president of the United States. By July 1969, when America placed a man on the 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 388 moon, only a dozen of the original thirty-four postu-lants were still members of my religious community. One month later, on the weekend in August when I professed first vows, a three-day \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Music and Arts Festival\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was held on a rural farm in upstate New York near the small town of Woodstock. The admission price was $6 a day. The following spring, in May 1970, students at Kent State University protesting the Vietnam War were shot and killed by National Guardsmen. In that same year, for the first time in anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memory of our commu-nity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hundred and forty years of existence, no one pro-fessed first vows. The decade of the 1960s was considered by some as possibly the best of times, and by others as positively the worst of times. For American Catholic sisters, it may simply have been, on the whole, the least auspicious of times for the church to suggest that we reassess every aspect of our lives. From the vantage point of nearly half a century, it seems that Pope John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basic intent in convoking the Second Vatican Council in 1959 may have been to initi-ate a radical renewal of all of Christian life. In other words, he may have envisioned a total conversion of mind and heart on the part of all Catholics and even all Christians. It seems he may have intended to sow the seeds of a personal and collective, intellectual and voli-tional metanoia in all believers, so that what Jesus Christ bequeathed to the church might further the salvation of humanity more effectively than it had the first two thou-sand years. Recall that by January 1959, when the council was first announced, the world had just witnessed the most continuously violent, humanly devastating half century in recorded history. From his vantage point, Pope John possibly considered it high time--or time well overdue-- Review for Religious for the whole church to reassess its meaning and role and self-understanding in face of the crying needs of humanity. Recall that Vatican II was convoked before the Berlin Wall appeared almost overnight, before the Cuban mis-sile crisis, before America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seventeen-year involvement in the Vietnam War, before the multiple assassinations and urban violence of the 1960s, before humanity first looked at the world from the moon, before the first ter-rorist attack at the 1972 Olympics, and before the suc-cessful cloning of animals. The council was convoked before the resolution of South African apartheid, before Sarajevo, before Rwanda, before Pol Pot in Cambodia, before Tiananmen Square in China, before the Lockerbie crash in Scotland, before Somalia, before the Gulf War, before Oklahoma City, before Columbine, and long before 9/11. It was convoked before the Iraq War, before Darfur, before the Beslan grade school massacre, before the impact of global warming, and before the global impact of AIDS. What, indeed, we might ask, would John xxIII pos-sibly think now? Perhaps much the same as he was think-ing in 1959, namely, that the church still needs to take a genuinely new look at itself and at the rest of reality in light of the salvation wrought by Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life-death-res-urrection- ascension. Whatever any of us may think, say, hope, or regret regarding the Second Vatican Council, few even suspect that the positive potential of its origi-nal intent has yet been realized. This is in part because much more time is needed theologically and practically to assess and to internalize what it said and did. But the council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrealized potential is also, at least in part, the result, of widely divergent interpretations of its content and meaning which have been categorically co-opted and systematically disseminated by clearly dichotomous seg- 64.4 2005 McDonougb * The Coundl as Catalyst A catalyst initiates a reaction and enables to,proceed under milder conditions than otherwise possible. 390 ments of ecclesial society. For nearly four decades, both sides of this ecclesial dichotomy have consciously sus-tained their combative engagement at all levels of church life. And they have done so with an energy and efficiency that has left most Catholics exhausted and not really very much renewed at all. Meanwhile, any genuine intellectual and volitional conversion that might more effectively bring Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salvation to the complex human and spir-itual needs of our battered world has not been afforded a fair chance to begin in earnest. So it seems to me. The title of this article refers to the council as a cat-alyst. A catalyst initiates a reaction and enables it to pro-ceed under milder conditions than otherwise possible. The council did initiate a reaction. When the council began, sis-ters in my community were all known by the names given them when they entered the novitiate. This change initi-ated us into an ego-effacing formation deliberately created to foster an encompassing new way of life. All our sisters lived in convents with local superiors and did things in order of rank from old-est to youngest according to when we had made profes-sion. We all ate in silence while someone read an article or book judged by the superior to be of some signifi-cance (which was often unknown to us who listened as we ate). We all ate whatever was served, though exceptions were made for personal illness. Some sisters seemed to have some personal illness rather regularly. A few seemed to have some personal illness for as long as anyone could remember. We generally washed our own dishes \\\\\\\\\\\\\"at table\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in a large dishpan of initially clean, soapy water. Review for Religious With rare exception, we never ate at unscheduled times and never ate outside of our own refectory (our term for dining room). We all had three habits: one for Sunday, one for our everyday apostolate, and one for work. Unlike men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reli-gious communities, wherein a habit could often be con-veniently donned or doffed, our habits were the only clothes we had. They were worn at all times except when we went to bed. We were fully \\\\\\\\\\\\\"habited\\\\\\\\\\\\\" at prayer, at our apostolate, at table, when working in the garden, when doing heavy housecleaning, and even when occa-sionally sledding or playing basketball with sisters around our age during a school break. Depending on where we were stationed (that is, where we were assigned to live and work), the work we did could be teaching a class of fifty or more students, peeling bushels of fruit, running industrial laundry equip-ment, washing dishes for as many as five hundred people, using large, heavy, institutional machines to wax wooden floors that had already been waxed far too many times before, or cleaning with toothbrushes the metal grids on the edges of three flights of stairs. This kind of work was not punishment. It was simply the way we took good care of things. We did almost all of the work ourselves, and almost everything was in perfect condition most of the time. We never wasted anything. Wrapping paper and ribbons, boxes and jars, aluminum foil and plastic containers--all were saved to be used again and again. Our families would joke about our reusing everything and called it \\\\\\\\\\\\\"nunny.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Nowadays many people do it but they call it ecology. We ordinarily awakened to a bell shortly after four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock and almost every minute of every day was sched-uled with some event or responsibility. We all retired at a specified time, usually no later than nine-thirty. 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 392 Permission was needed for exceptions. After the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"lights out\\\\\\\\\\\\\" time, some sisters read books in bed under the cov-ers with a flashligl~t. Our rooms were rather small (about 8 x 14 ft.), but they usually had everything we really needed. Back then what we really needed were a bed, a bedside table, a desk, a bookcase, a chair, a lamp, a closet, and a small dresser. Every room had a crucifix on the wall and a little bottle of holy water on the dresser. We did not hang other things on the walls, and we did not have nicknacks. In some of our convents, a few sisters lived in dormitories with curtains separating generally equal spaces which contained mostly the same furniture. In some convents the rooms might have a small sink and a small easy chair. We had common bathroom facilities, but often the superior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room had a private bath. Superiors also had a small, separate office, and the house treasurer usually did too. We could write to our family once a week. Family members could visit occasionally, oftener and more briefly if they lived nearby, less often and longer if they lived farther away. On these visits we never had meals together. We ate in the refectory with the sisters, and our families ate in the guest dining room. Any gifts our family brought were given immediately to the superior, who transferred the best of everything to the chaplain or the pastor if they were things a priest could use. We all regularly asked permission from the superior for doing such things as opening our mail, using the books at our disposal, and having necessary personal toi-let articles. About once a month the superior conducted a meeting of all the sisters which was known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"chapter of faults.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This had been a salutary monastic practice of publicly admitting to the sisters with whom you lived your own externally manifest foibles and failures and then asking forgiveness. But by the 1960s this practice Review for Religious had been truly trivialized into merely mentioning some fault from a previously prepared list of supposedly light or medium or serious ones. They ranged from leaving something out of place to talking during \\\\\\\\\\\\\"times of silence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Things we actually did or failed to do that really annoyed one another were mostly not on the list. It did not matter much what a sister mentioned from the list, because the sisters you lived with were already very much aware of your external foibles and failures. Some were even aware of your internal ones. What we actually did or failed to do that really annoyed each other was seldom on the list, - - but these provided the ever-present, unrelenting, mutual sandpaper of our lives together. Every sister knew it, all too well. Most sisters in local-community convents had sev-eral jobs besides teaching. Shortly after first profession I taught five classes of math a day (algebra, geometry, trigonometry) at a co-ed high school of a thousand stu-dents, was in charge of the bookstore (textbooks, sta-tionery supplies), was responsible for the convent cars (keeping them clean, full of gas, and fixed when neces-sary), was convent treasurer (\\\\\\\\\\\\\"qualified\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because I taught math), and traveled a hundred miles each Saturday for M.A. studies financed by a National Science Foundation grant. What I was doing was not unusual, it seems to me. But we were much younger then. When Vatican II began, the religious community I entered had 720 members. It owned and operated two colleges for women, three highly successful high schools, and a small hospital. All of these had a sister as presi- Most sisters in local-community convents had several jobs besides teaching. 64.4 200~ McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Coundl as Catalyst 3941 dent, principal, or CEO. All of these had at least a dozen sisters serving in various capacities. We also staffed sev-eral large Catholic high schools and more than three dozen Catholic grade schools in various dioceses in five different states. We were known for being quite good at what we did, and it seemed to me we were. We related professionally to the lay people with whom we worked, but we never really socialized with them. They were called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"seculars,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the sisters greatly outnumbered them. By the time I entered, because learning and teach-ing were central to our heritage, it was rare for a sister to be assigned to teach without having at least a B.A. degree. Many sisters already had or were studying for master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or doctoral degrees. Except for those studying, we all came \\\\\\\\\\\\\"home\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to the motherhouse and worked there or nearby during the summer months. In mid August year after year, we received any new assignments by hearing a list read aloud to all of us assembled in the motherhouse chapel. We were not consulted about the assignments. The very next day we were all on our way to this or that convent in this or that town, each of us with all our belongings. Back then, those belongings always fitted into one large trunk plus, for some, a small suitcase. The convent in which you landed in those days might be subject to the occasional but dreadfully harmful tyranny of a superior who probably should never have had a position of authority. In those days the mother general--the sister in charge of the whole congregation, who herself was elected--appointed all the local superi-ors. It was only in the mid 1970s that sisters in our local houses got to elect their own superior. The election of the mother general took place every four years at a for-mal, solemn gathering called the general chapter. All the sisters voted for delegates to the chapter, and the dele- Review for Religqous gates elected the mother general and the four councilors who assisted her. Besides the elections, these delegates also made decisions about other things that concerned the whole community. While the chapter was in progress, the rest of us usually did not know much about what was going on, although a few always seemed to know most of what was going on everywhere. In local communities, some superiors treated author-ity as a matter of control and more or less trampled on the sensibilities of others in the house, except for favorites of theirs (for whatever reason). In retrospect, it seems that the favorites were being groomed to become future superiors. Many of them did. The nonfavorites were thankful when they were assigned to another house or when the superior went \\\\\\\\\\\\\"out of office.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Some incom-petent superiors, recycled in a sort of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"lateral arabesque,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wreaked havoc again on sisters elsewhere. Such superi-ors were the exception, not the norm. But they were really notable exceptions if they were your own supe-rior. The convent in which you landed could also fall under the diplomatically gloved but predominantly iron hand of a local pastor who controlled everything, from the horarium (our daily schedule) to the purse strings. Back then, financial remuneration for sisters was a pittance. In the early 1970s I was among twenty-eight sisters in a city with one of the highest per capita incomes in the country. Two dozen of us had degrees, some even graduate degrees. We taught in a large diocesan high school or in a nearby parish grade school or worked in a diocesan office. One sister was a full-time cook for the convent. Though not many of us knew how to cook for twenty-eight people, we took turns helping to cook on weekends. Every sister in the convent received a salary of $1,800 per year. Of course, the convent and its mainte-nance were paid for by the parish or school, and we had 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 396 three cars for our use, paying only the cost of gas for community trips. At that time there was rarely any for-mal provision for sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 healthcare, but most necessary medical services were donated by local doctors and den-fists. No one ever even thought of retiring, so no retire-ment funds were ever requested or received. It all \\\\\\\\\\\\\"worked\\\\\\\\\\\\\" fiscally because there were so many of us and we were so young and lived so frugally. I cannot say we went without necessities and must admit we also had occasional extra amenities that were probably unavailable to most of our own families. Remarkably--or perhaps not so remarkably--we usually sent a monthly surplus to the motherhouse. In that way, convents which had difficulties in making ends meet could be given sup-plements from the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general fund. The gen-eral fund also supported our older sisters when they were no longer able to work, but every sister worked for as long as she could. In retrospect it seems that, if we had received higher stipends, we could have recycled much more of that town\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wealth into poorer schools and parishes elsewhere through our sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 donated services. Like most sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 communities, we also operated schools where many parents simply could not pay any tuition at all. Wherever you lived back then, ever-present poten-tial pitfalls of our life together centered on the possible overemphasis on externals or a possibly excessive legalism in observing regulations as supposedly indicative of what constituted a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"good sister.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I label them potential pitfalls because, in retrospect, there may have been only three basic ways for us to deal constructively with the exter-nals and the legalism. These realities seemed to domi-nate the entire ethos of Catholicism in America before Vatican II, and they certainly fit all too comfortably into the total ambience of religious life. But, to be construc- Review for Religious tive about it, you could basically only comply with the externals or you could identify with them or you could try to internalize their meaning. Whether or not a sister was really prone to legalism was somehow related to which of the above options predominated for her. Back then, it seemed that just about any sister who wanted to stay in the convent could learn to comply with just about everything that was asked of her, and most did. Even if you did not like doing this or that, you could usually appear pretty good at doing it. Even novices could learn to comply externally most of the time, or at least enough of the time to be admitted to first profes-sion. At another level, back then it seemed to me that most sisters rather readily identified with the communal importance of what was expected of us for the sake of the bigger picture of who we were together. And most somehow sensed that who we were together was immensely greater than the sum of the parts. So the value of accepting certain externals of our collective identity, such as living and praying and working together or wear-ing the same habit or engaging in common practices, was eventually mostly integrated as part of the overall package that both strengthened and assuaged the ins and outs of the day-to-day reality of our lives. But, at still another level, back then it seemed to me that you could personally and spiritually internalize what-ever you did as fitting somehow in the adventure of hav-ing promised your whole life to God no matter what. It also seemed to me that some sisters, mostly older ones, had actually internalized what it might really mean to live our life within the ambience of all the externals but with a balance and healthiness that had no hint of legal-ism. They seemed to understand that none of the exter-nals were the essentials. They also seemed to understand 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 398 that all we did was intended to foster somehow the life we publicly professed and interiorly hoped to live. I think we all truly hoped to be good, maybe even holy. And I think we all truly wanted to do good, no matter what we actually happened to do. From the deeper, longer, wiser perspective of these seasoned sisters, the externals seemed to matter less, even though they were faithful in observ-ing them. For sure, very early on, I knew I definitely wanted to belong someday to the last group just described. In the midst of all this, it also seemed to me that most of us were happy and productive most of the time. We mostly tried to be prayerful women as best we knew how and to be responsively obedient in sometimes diffi-cult circumstances. For the most part, we had fun with one another, good clean fun, much more often than onlookers may ever have suspected. For the most part, we were quite competent at what we did in significant areas of education, study, and learning. And the regimenta-tion of much of our life even afforded some sisters the opportunity of serving others much more effectively than they might have done on their own. Somehow, in com-munities of women religious forty years ago, in some real way, we really were family to one another, warts and all. And through it all, perhaps in spite of it all, we were definitely not all alike, and we knew it. We knew that no visible similarities rendered us actually similar. But we knew, too, that in many ways all was not well with the way we lived and that much could or should be effec-tively changed for the better. From the moment conciliar documents were avail-able in English, the sisters in my community enthusias-tically read and studied them. The promulgation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy in December 1963 had enormous positive consequences for American Review for Religious Catholic sisters. Until then, other than Mass, prayer in common for sisters in communities with post- Reformation origins often consisted entirely of medita-tion in common, various litanies~ multiple rosaries, and numerous devotional prayers composed by whoever had founded them. In these communities the meditation topic was usually chosen by the superior, announced the evening before, and had an obligatory format usually fol-lowing standard steps adapted from Ignatian spiritual-ity or from a variation of the 17th-century French school of spirituality. Sisters in communities tracing their her-itage to before the Reformation usually prayed a short-ened \\\\\\\\\\\\\"little office\\\\\\\\\\\\\" consisting of psalms, with antiphons and responses in honor of the Sacred Heart, the Blessed Virgin Mary, or others. These communities also prayed the rosary in common, but usually had fewer litanies and devotional prayers. Meditation was always in chapel together at an early hour, but a common meditation topic or specific method set by the superior would not usu-ally have been obligatory. Before the council, for the most part, only clergy were considered as officially praying the official Divine Office in the name of the church and as part of its offi-cial worship. Indeed, even if nonclergy prayed the same Divine Office from the same books, it was not considered participation in the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liturgical prayer. Very soon, however, sisters in communities of any heritage began chorally praying the psalms of the breviary and finding this practice to be immensely more meaningful than their previous devotions. The promulgation of the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation in November 1965 also proved particularly significant for American Catholic sisters, who responded instantly and enthusiastically to new or renewed biblical studies. But no conciliar document altered the reality of reli- 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Ca~alys~ gious life for sisters in apostolic congregations in the United States more than the Decree on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Accommodata Renovatione\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of Religious Life promulgated in October 1965. The Latin phrase accommodata renovatione is delib-erately retained here, not to be pedantic, but because this cryptic description of what was apparently intended for religious life is not easily translated and because one common translation--\\\\\\\\\\\\\"adaptation and renewal\\\\\\\\\\\\\"--is sim-ply not correct. This erroneous translation, however, was at first used so frequently that dichotomous expla-nations arose describing \\\\\\\\\\\\\"adaptation\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as pertaining to external elements of religious life and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"renewal\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as per-taining to internal, spiritual matters of religious life. The title actually called for the entire reality of religious life to be renewed or restored or refreshed or revived in a suitable or fitting manner. This was quite in keeping with John xxIII\\xe2\\x80\\x99S intention that the church more effec-tively bring the riches of salvation in Christ to bear on humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate and ultimate needs. To this end, article 2 of Perfectae caritatis made clear that effective renewal should occur under the influence of the Holy Spirit and with church guidance. It would involve returning to both the sources of Christian life and the initial inspiration of religious communities as adapted to the altered conditions of current times. PC (Perfectae caritatis, not personal computer!) affirmed fol-lowing Christ in the Gospels as the supreme rule of life for every religious, while urging acceptance and retention of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original spirit and aims and sound traditions. It encouraged religious institutes to foster church initiatives in keeping with their own proper char-acter. It mandated that communities should help their members to better understand human realities, world conditions, and the needs of the church. It strongly reaf-firmed the profession of the evangelical counsels and Review for Religious clearly emphasized the importance of spiritual renewal. Article 3 of PC asked every religious community to harmonize its life, prayer, and work with the physical and psychological condition of its members, and it asked us to do likewise in relation to the apostolate, the sur-rounding culture, and overall economic circumstances. It mandated examination of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mode of gov-ernment and called for proper revision of constitutions, directories, customs, prayers, and ceremonies in order to bring them into sync with changes promulgated in other conciliar documents. Article 4 of Perfectae caritatis urged the cooperation of all community members in the renewal effort, which it particularly entrusted to competent internal authorities such as general chapters and legitimate superiors. At the same time, it required superiors to consult with com-munity members and to actually listen to them. So it seemed to most of us that someone somewhere who had worked on the formulation of PC must have known that many things might need changing from the way they were back then. All this was prescribed in the context of our individ-ual response to a divine call to express our baptismal consecration more fully by living solely for God with an apostolic orientation in service of the church (articles 5 and 8). Not surprisingly, PC reaffirmed that the three evangelical counsels commonly professed by religious are spiritually and humanly efficacious for fostering maturity, responsible interaction with authority, and con-structive life together. The reordering of the traditional vow sequence from poverty-chastity-obedience to chastity-poverty-obedience was noted, though there was no evident reason for it (articles 12-15).

It initiated longer and more com-prehensive formation (article 18) and urged maintenance of current ministries while simultaneously calling for a renewed missionary spirit (article 20). And it pointedly reminded religious everywhere that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"example of their own lives\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was the best invitation for others to join them in this way of witness in the church (article 23). Without a doubt, women religious in the United States took these conciliar mandates and challenges quite seriously, responding to them with astounding interest and concerted action. And, without a doubt, Vatican II was a catalyst for renewal. It initi-ated a genuine, whole-hearted, enthusiastic response on the part of American Catholic sis-ters regarding who they were, how they lived and prayed, what they did, and what they were being called to do. On the other hand, from the vantage point of hindsight, it is now rather clear that many changes in religious life catalyzed by the coun-cil did not proceed under the milder conditions that cat-alytic conversions are supposed to make possible. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, experimentation in living and praying and working seems never to have ended, while in some communities their living and praying and working seems never to have changed. In most communities of American Catholic sis-ters, constitutional revisions seem never to have found Review for Religious the last, best way of expressing what sisters really want to say, while in some communities only grammar and syn-tax seem to have been altered, and only minimally. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, corporate apostolates have almost completely disappeared, while in some communities apostolic endeavors seem to have remained exactly the same as they were forty years ago. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, many members wear completely secular attire, while in some communities the sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 only attire remains a Sunday or weekday or work habit, one of which is worn at all times. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, many members live alone in rented apartments, are responsible to no internal superior below the gen-eral council (now commonly known as a leadership team), find their own jobs, visit relatives at their own convenience, organize their own work schedules, and are basically responsible for maintaining their own well-being. In stark contrast, in some communities life is very much the same as it was forty years ago: all sisters live in convents, are assigned to ministry with little consulta-tion, have local superiors, follow a standard horarium, eat in common, wash dishes at table, never visit their families overnight, and--among a plethora of other per-sonal human constraints--may still be permitted to shower or bathe only once a week. This article refers to the council as a catalyst. In ret-rospect, it is clear that the catalytic impulse of the coun-cil occurred during a decade of rapid and sweeping cultural upheavals in the world. In retrospect, it is also clear that in the United States the catalytic impulse of Vatican lI coincided with conditions of extreme social turbulence. Ostensibly genuine responses to the man-dates of Vatican II during a time of great and ongoing social unrest seem to have resulted forty years later in a 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst far more than minimal divergence in the ways various communities of sisters in America live and pray and work. From what appear to be the result of forces in play forty years ago, in merely human terms the 1960s may have been the least auspicious time for the church to have sug-gested that American Catholic sisters should reassess every aspect of their lives. Indeed, it seems that strongly affirmed good inten-tions and long-sustained earnest efforts have actually brought American Catholic sisters to diametrically opposed positions of immense disparity in spirituality, theology, apostolic endeavors, internal structures, and overall functioning. In four decades of trying to achieve an accommodata renovatio, many communities of American Catholic sisters appear to have unconsciously but enthu-siastically adapted themselves into impending oblivion, while some other communities of American Catholic sis-ters appear to have consciously and steadfastly remained basically unrenewed. And, in this ongoing process, the genuine challenge of Vatican Council II for religious life as a gift to the church--and to the waiting world-- remains as yet overwhelmingly unrealized.

Walter Bunofsky SVD Review for Religious CHRISTIAN RAAB Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney Toe 1993 Harold Ramis film Groundhog Day is the ry of a television weatherman named Phil, played by Bill Murray, who soon finds himself in a time warp. As the film begins, Phil is cocky, sarcastic, and self-important and resents being sent to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the Groundhog Day festival. He spends the day ridiculing the provin-cialisms of the people, bragging about his chances of becoming an anchorman, and trying, rather rudely, to charm his attractive ~producer, Rita, played by Andie MacDowell. At day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TV crew gets snowed in. Phil awakens the next day to discover that it is February 2 once again, though he is the only one who seems to notice. He relives the whole day, encounter by encounter, no more gracefully and with even more frustration than he had the day before. He finally goes to bed, hoping that he has gotten over the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worst case of d4j~ vu. He awakens, however, to find that it is February 2 for Christian Raab OSB is a newly professed Benedictine monk at St. Meinrad Archabbey\\\\\", \\\\\"100 Hill Drive\\\\\", \\\\\"St. Meinrad, Indiana 47577. 64.4 200Y Raab \\xc2\\xaf Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney the third time. These repetitions continue for the rest of the movie. Phil quite clearly has become stuck in Groundhog Day. As he keeps reliving this day and reencountering the people in it, Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reactions change--from utter frus-tration and angry outbursts to something else. He real-izes that a life without consequences beyond one day can be used for unbounded pleasure seeking. When he tires of this, he turns his attention toward winning the heart of Rita. He spends days figuring out who the perfect man is in Rita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, and then he pretends to be this person. Needless to say, it does not work. Phil responds with despair and, believing it is the only way out of his private hell, tries again and again to end his life. After each attempt, however, he awakens to the same song on the radio and sees that it is still February 2. Finally Phil recognizes that his selfishness is getting him nowhere. He begins to live for others. He gets to know people and responds to their needs. He feeds a homeless man. He is kind to an annoying character. He helps counsel a young couple. He knows what time every day several old ladies get a flat tire and hurries there to fix it for them. He knows what time each day a young boy falls from a tree, and he rushes there to catch him. Discovering that he has a gift for music, he develops and shares it. He becomes part of the community he once ridiculed, and at last, by forgetting himself, he escapes his fate and reaches February 3. There is something about Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Groundhog Day that living as a novice in a Benedictine monastery resonates with. Benedictine iife, especially in the novitiate, is very structured and repetitive. Every day begins the same. At 5:15 a.m., the bells announce Morning Prayer. After Morning Prayer is breakfast, then private spiritual read-ing. At 7:30 a.m. we return to church for Mass. When Review for Religious this is over, we may grab a quick cup of coffee before the workday begins at 8:30 a.m. Coffee break is at 10 a.m. At noon comes Midday Prayer and then lunch, fol-lowed by work or class again at 1 p.m. At 4:30 p.m. the workday ends. The monks go back to church at 5 p.m. for Vespers. After this we have another period of private spiritual reading, and then at 6 p.m. we meet for the evening meal. After dinner, monks are usually free to recreate, study, or go to bed, as the case may be. The monk ends his day, goes to sleep, awakens again the next day to the ring-ing of the bells, and the cycle begins again. It is - - a structured, repetitive, and somewhat predictable life. In some ways, every day feels the same. Of course, this structured life is not just a repetition of practices. More important, it is a repetition of encoun-ters with people. It is easy to know that a particular brother can be expected to sit at a particular place in the refectory during breakfast. A certain father will be arriv-ing at the coffeemaker at 7 a.m. Some monks will sit on this side of the calefactory during coffee, break, and oth-ers will sit on the other side. We expect to see certain monks in the computer lab before we open the door. We know who will almost surely be playing cards after supper. We become familiar with the sounds of monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 breathing and walking. We begin to know who will like a book and who will hate it, who will take a joke and who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, who likes hugs and who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, who prefers the mornings and who prefers the evenings. In the way that monastic life provides a series of repeat encounters This structured life is not just a repetition of practices\\\\\", \\\\\"it is a repetition of encounters with people. 407 64.4 2005 Raab \\xc2\\xaf Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney 408 and practices, it is not much different from Groundhog Day. The monk, unlike Phil, voluntarily chooses this life of repetitive practices and encounters in connection with the vow of stability. The vow is a monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise to stay in the same place with the same people and engage in the same monastic practices for the rest of his life. Like all the vows, stability is a means toward the end of con-version. Our Brother John Mark explains that stability aids conversion by providing a sure and solid context in which the human will may conform to the will of the loving God. He compares the human will to a steel rod that, in conversion, is bent into conformity with the divine will. One cannot bend a rod without having something strong and solid to hold it in place. This is what stabil-ity does. It provides the strong and solid foundation that makes conversion--the bending of the rod--possible. Stability means the monk stays put. He commits to repeat his day over and over again in the same place with the same people doing the same things. And so the monk, in a very real way, is choosing to do what Phil did invol-untarily, to stay in one place, to relive and reencounter while being transformed. Repetition can help us with this transformation, not merely by keeping us surefooted, but by supplying and resupplying opportunities for loving choices. For exam-ple, because I am in this repetitive life, each day I have the opportunity to be more attentive in liturgy, and to be more open in prayer, than I was earlier. As I live and work each day alongside some people who annoy me, I have the opportunity to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"love my enemies,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to set aside grievances, to practice patience, to exercise charity. Each day I have the opportunity to anticipate needs in the elderly monks, to clean things with more care than I did Review for Religious the day before, to listen with more receptivity to the lonely and the needy. Because so many of our experiences and encounters repeat themselves, I am, each day and always, given the opportunity to be humble where I was proud, to be chaste where I was lustful, to be calm where I was angry, to be forgiving where I was unforgiving, to be assertive where I was a pushover. In this way, stability, by its rep-etition, can be accepted as a great gift on the path to holiness. The monk who perseveres can, like Phil, be trans-formed. Like Phil, we may come to this life with prob-lems of self-centeredness, sarcasm, conceit, anger, despair, or lust. But, if we are open to the grace that comes with living, out stability in a monastic community, we, like Phil, may be transformed into persons of char-ity. In the last scene of Groundhog Day, Phil has finally \\\\\\\\\\\\\"gotten it right\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the morrow has finally come. On the morning of February 3, the now-transformed Phil says to Rita with joyful single-mindedness, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Is there any-thing I can do for you today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is this monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope that he may be able to start his own day, each day, with the same happy singularity of purpose, saying to my broth-ers and to God, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Is there anything I can do for you today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" ZPlease:note that the phone and fax number for the editorial offices of Review for Religious :have changed.

He forged his ideas 6n the hard anvil of his own conversion and his need, as a bishop, to defend the teaching of the Catholic Church. This combination of speculation and experience gives his writings a unique ongoing relevance. Their blending of the theoretical and the practical is nowhere more evident than in his teaching on the Holy Spirit. His Spirit doc-trine develops through three movements: his agonizing effort leading to his conversion, his need as a pastor to explain the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doc-trines, and his awareness that the action of grace is the love of the Holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts.

God is always surprising her by speaking through quite different people-- sometimes young and at other times old or in-between, sometimes male and at other times female. This young woman is portrayed as a very ordinary person, but her experiences of God seem to set her apart. If we were to be asked where most consistently we experience God, I doubt that many of us would say that we hear God speaking to us. In fact, we tend to be wary of people who hear \\\\\"voices\\\\\" or God speaking to them. Yet the God of the Old and New Testaments is a communicator. We identify the scriptures as the word of God. Christian prayer has always been understood as a dialogue, with both God and ourselves speaking and listening to each other. What we are sometimes slow to recog-nize is that God communicates not just in words. In the whole world of creation, God is speaking. Our personal talents, our gifts, our traits tell us that God has loved us personally into existence. People have always found the majesty of God in the surging of the ocean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Review for Religious waves, in the soaring heights of mountain peaks, and in the rosy-fingered morning sun. Certain people coming into our lives make real to us the call, the concern, the compassion of God. Their very presence makes us feel touched by God. We Catholics have always held our saints in great esteem and affection. They continue to touch us with God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence. We remember our dead because they too, strikingly holy or not, have spoken to us of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care. We ask for their help because they relate us to God. And so God speaks to us not only in the sacred words of Scripture, but also through people and things and events of our everyday environment. Modern psychology has made us aware that we com-municate through body language. God, too, uses body language to talk to us. Every time we celebrate Christmas we can \\\\\"hear\\\\\" what God is saying to us through the baby Jesus. No one is frightened by a baby--seeing no stern judge or a wrathful and punishing monarch. The baby Jesus reaches out and hands himself over to us in great freedom and trust and love. This baby in a manger-- Jesus--is God speaking. The wonder of Christmas brings home to us how, first among all .the other ways of com-municating, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incarnate Word speaks to us. What we need to observe in a more daily way is the silence of a Christmas night so that we can watch and listen. Perhaps that is our New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resolution. David L. Fleming SJ ES. The Review for Religious staff and board mem-bers pray for a holy and blessed Advent and Christmas seasons for all of our readers. 64.4 2005 JAMES A. RAFFERTY Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation praying This reflection looks at the relationship between Mary and the Eucharistic Lord. It attempts to show, in particular, Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intimate presence to the Eucharist. As a woman at the center of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for all humanity, Mary may properly be identified as Woman of the Eucharist, the title both reverential and affectionate that Pope John Paul employs in his encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia. This title is not merely a clever the-ological phrase about Mary symbolizing the entire church by her faith and receptive coop-eration. The title is about Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profound spir-itual relationship with her Son. Attuned as no other to the intimate communion deep within the Trinity, Mary singularly understands Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Eucharistic heart as it embraces all humanity in choosing Calvary, where self-surrendering love is displayed in shocking degree. James A. Rafferty, a priest of the Diocese of Scranton, is chaplain and a campus minister at Marywood University\",\"2300 Adams Avenue\",\"Scranton, Pennsylvania 18509. Review for Religious More than a theological category or doctrinal for-mulation, Mary, Woman of Eucharist, sings the hymn of one woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surrender to the divine Love that gently invites people to become more like itself. The sacra-mental Eucharist we celebrate today has its peak expres-sion in the Last Supper that opens the original drama of the paschal mystery, but Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Eucharistic offering is not limited to those hours of his life. Rather, his entire being may be described as Eucharist--sacrificial self-offering emboldened by an enormous gratitude. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, too, chants her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic hymn of praise and self-gift long before she accompanies him to the moment when he hands over all that he is on the cross. Eucharistic tones reverberate in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immaculate con-ception, in the annunciation, in her hearing her Son pro-claim the kingdom, in her presence at Calvary, and in her sharing in the Easter glory. The first Eucharistic moment in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, as in everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, is the moment of conception. Like everyone else, Mary receives her unique and unrepeatable iden-tity as nothing other than gift, gift to herself and to the world. Births celebrate the overflowing of love from the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart into time and space, letting itself be known in the life of another. Life itself means receiving what we cannot give or produce on our own. This divine gift is always more splendid than cellular interactions and anatomical functions. The Spirit of God breathing into clay sacramentalizes the loving communion of the Creator with the created. Physical existence, even veiled in the womb, announces the divine creative imagination that renders each life sacred by bearing the image and likeness of the Triune God. While every new human life arouses awe and thank-fulness in the presence of this loving gift from God, the humble daughter of Israel has an unprecedented 343 64.4 2005 Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation God creates Mary as one ready to welcome, grace without resistance, Eucharistic glow from her immaculate conception. The child of Anne and Joachim receives from her first instant the totally unmerited gift of being preserved by God from all stain of original sin. God creates Mary as one ready to welcome grace without resistance. Her very dis-position is to seek always what is the delight of her Creator and Lord. In her immaculate heart Mary bows before the tender stirrings of the Spirit of Yahweh. She never lurches away from the Lord in willful-ness. Her submission to God is like the strings of a peerless violin at the touch of a skilled violinist. The instrument exists precisely to give resonance to the master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s melody and fill the air with music. The violinist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s touch is not subjugation. It frees the instrument to be its fullest self. Mary cooperates wholly in all that God desires for her. We pray during the liturgy for something of her receptivity when we say, \\\\\"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word, and I shall be healed.\\\\\" Although these words originate in Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 encounter with a centurion concerned for his servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health, the litur-gical context may suggest Zacchaeus, delighted to wel-come Jesus to his home and almost happy at not concealing how much his soul has needed tidying up. As we approach the altar to receive the gift of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Body and Blood, it seems that Jesus wishes to evoke within us Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change of heart: first refusing to let Jesus wash his feet and then eagerly conceding at Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 insistence. Again, the Immaculate Conception is a permanent stance of receptivity. We seek that disposition in our own prepa-ration for Communion. Review for Religious The Eucharistic motif appears in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life also in her obscurity and poverty. Her simple, humble existence in a tiny village reflects the Eucharist. There Mary depends utterly on God. Mary experiences a real, not just a romantic, poverty. She feels with all who are poor the realities of hunger, cold, and powerlessness. For her the cry of the poor is not a hypothetical, poetic verse\",\"it echoes her authentic abandonment to the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provi-dence in situations where human efforts do not accom-plish much. There is more here than a passive resolve to endure difficulty and want. Mary finds comfort and assur-ance in a faithful God who has pledged never to aban-don the people he has chosen to be his own. As a woman of actual poverty, Mary relates to God as the provider of her daily needs. She carries within her a practiced confi-dence that God attends to her hunger and thirst, a heart-felt trust that breaks into the praise of the Magnificat. She lives out of the consciousness that it is God who feeds, nourishes, and sustains. Her poverty expresses sol-idarity with every child of the Covenant who awaits God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saving action. Such indomitable hope, passed on across centuries, has been planted deep in Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic living is evident in the moment when divinity unites with human flesh at her consent, \\\\\"Let it be done to me according to your word.\\\\\" The Lord instituted the sacramental Eucharist for us to con-sume and thereby have the divine life pulsing strongly within us. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\"yes\\\\\" to the invitation of God fore-shadows our \\\\\"amen\\\\\" at being offered the Eucharist. Amen here means \\\\\"Yes, I believe it is the Body of Christ, and, yes, I wish to receive it.\\\\\" It is implicitly a consent that the Body of Christ broken, offered, received, and consumed may effect a change in us who partake.of it. As believers we surrender before the mystery in a way similar to Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\"Let it be done to me.\\\\\" Like Mary at the annun- 64.4 2005 Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation 346 ciation, in the Eucharist we implicitly desire that the Trinity take over our life so that our identity, fused with Jesus himself, lets itself be guided by God the Father. When the angel appears to Mary with the message that she will conceive and bear a son who will be called Son of the Most High, she perceives the compassion radiating from the heart of God. This radiance accom-panies the self-surrender of the God who comes to dwell in flesh. By the grace of the Holy Spirit, Mary is drawn into God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan, which includes Calvary. In the powerful current of paschal love, she more than anyone else glimpses the yearning of God to heal the rift that sin causes in the relationship between Creator and creature. Every act of God in the salvific economy bears a paschal orientation, and Mary intuits the paschal horizon of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s project. That is, she senses the truth of what she meets in the annunciation--a self-offering Love that knows no limitation. Lacking the vocabulary of Trinitarian theology, Mary nonetheless encounters the Father offering his Son in the power of the Holy Spirit. She experiences deep within her the distinct energies of the Trinitarian per-sons, as if eavesdropping on the dialogue of the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan for her. Mary knows, then, a Father sharing his Son with her, and she knows this contemplatively in the depths of her being. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pregnancy does not begin as a mere procedural accomplishment, as valued posses-sions are handed over to faithful friends for safekeeping. Because the Spirit of God fills her, Mary senses the meaning of this act for the Father. The Father is hand-ing over to her, and through her to all humanity, that which is most precious to him, his beloved Son. Mary knows this with her whole being. She knows, too, the Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active participation in this gift-giving. Before the throne of the Father in heaven, Review for Religious the Son exercises the characteristic obedience that he will manifest in the world even to death. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99sfiat opens the path for the eternal Word to enact his incarnation in space and time. The Son exchanges the omnipotence of divine majesty for confinement in the womb of a young woman. The Second Person of the Trinity assumes human nature in its meekest form and progresses accord-ing to the physiological laws of the human condi-tion. Mary, of course, does not, by virtue of her experience of the annun-ciation, have unrestricted access to the mind of God. She remains thor-oughly finite. Like every other human being, she knows only what she can experience. There pre-cisely do we find the glory in the incarnation, the splendid miracle that Mary is the first to perceive--God revealed in human frailty. Mary is present to the moment when the Son clothes himself in the frailty, dependence, poverty, and even death that mark every human life. The words of consecration so familiar in the Eucharistic Prayer are already subtly present at the annunciation. \\\\\"You will conceive and bear a son.\\\\\" \\\\\"How can this be?\\\\\" \\\\\"The power of the Most High will over-shadow you.\\\\\" It is as if all of creation--a suffering world yearning for the healing that it is helpless to achieve on its own--has been imploring the Holy Spirit, in one great wordless epidesis, to fill the virginal womb with life. And God responds by making himself present in history for children and adults to see, hear, and touch--and be Mary is present to the moment when the Son clothes himself in the ~ailty, dependence, poverty, and even death that mark every human life. 347 64.4 200Y Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation touched by. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response is personal and collective. She speaks on behalf of a wounded race. Generation after generation of messianic hope permeates the Jewish faith. In Mary and others like Anna and Simeon, this hope is not merely a passive waiting and watching. More than that, it is an ever intensifying desire, calling upon God fervently and ceaselessly from amid the welter of the human condition. Here is the imploring epiclesis to which the Father answers in the incarnation of his Son.. To this intensification of Jewish prayer may be added the human hearts all over the world humbly defenseless under the weight and the stings of evil. Moved by their sobs and their silence, God intervenes decisively. Through the Holy Spirit and Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yes, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Son becomes present in her womb. This is similar to what occurs in the liturgy. Mary offers herself in conjunction with the cries of a people lost in darkness, and the Holy Spirit completes her offering infinitely by bringing about the presence of Jesus in her womb. The divine love in this human form is Light itself amid earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s darkness. Surrendering himself to the human condition, the Son of God encompasses the human race\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad history in himself. He submits himself to the force of evil that pummels, confuses, and obliterates. At the first moment made possible by Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assent, the world begins to hear the Son whisper, \\\\\"Take this, all of you, and eat it, this is my body\",\"take and drink, this is my blood, given up for you.\\\\\" Mary silently possesses more than an inkling of the self-surrender that God envi-sions. The Son empties himself by taking on human nature, and Mary nourishes humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-sacrificing Savior towards his birth. She and he both anticipate his self-offering on the cross, the offering that rises from burial into resurrection a~l is present each time the Eucharist is celebrated. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praying heart delights in Review for Religious the wonder, adoration, and gratitude with which she accompanies the Child she carries. With maternal love she worships thankfully the Presence within her in a unique Communion. The proclamation of the kingdom of God, too, is redolent of the F~ucharistic. In the Spirit, all grace of whatever form moves human hearts to Communion. People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gifts or fruits of prayer come to naught unless they seek and find some externalization in unity, in Communion. The Spirit is Communio, and all grace drives toward perfect fulfillment in the heavenly ban-quet, the wedding feast of the Lamb, for which the litur-gical sacrifice prepares us. No wonder, then, that the New Testament\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eucharistic imagery appears in the ear-liest moments of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 public ministry. At the Jordan, Jesus, who is without sin, does not accept John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s baptism as a gesture of solidarity with weaker brothers and sisters. He is maturely aware of his right relationship with Yahweh. His decision to approach the Baptist, like his acceptance of the cross, manifests publicly the full sur-render to the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will that he has made in prayer many times. Here at the Jordan, Jesus offers himself unreservedly to his Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. He pledges himself to the kingdom that John has heralded. In sublime intimacy the Son prays, \\\\\"Take this, Father, it is yours.\\\\\" He hands over to the Father all that he receives: his body, his energy, his desire, his relationships\",\"his future. At the Jordan, at the proper time, the Son relives on earth his own unseen choice in eternity to become incarnate. His Father accepts his self-offering and blesses it with the epiphany that confirms the beloved Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity. As Jesus undertakes his public ministry, right from the beginning he gathers a community from people who have little in common other than their friendship with Jesus and the willingness to risk being in his company. 64.4 200~ Rafferty * Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation Mary playsa role in , this formation of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s followers inlto a Eucharistic coinmunityi Jesus does not announce the kingdom as some exhila-rating new ideology or political vision. Rather, he forms relationships and then sees to it that they form rela-tionships with one another. And he gets them sharing in his own relationship, his own communion, with the Father. Today the Eucharistic table is the special place where the Father reaches out to his sons and daughters and where they seek the deep unity among themselves that they find occurs only when God is in their midst. In celebrating the Eucharist, Christians accompany Jesus and attend to his words and actions, and he forms the church in his paschal love just as he did with his first disciples. Mary, Woman of the Eucharist, plays a role in this formation of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s followers into a Eucharistic com-munity. Here this does not mean intuitions of their rit-ual participation in the Mass. Rather, it means learning a new way of being loved by God. Their souls are being awakened to tolerate and then to rejoice that Jesus comes not to be served but to serve. The Spirit is slowly instructing them in the language of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart, which speaks most eloquently in the silence of Good Friday. But, preparing for that day, Jesus brings his friends and coworkers home with him to Nazareth and to Mary. They have left home and livelihood to stay with him. They are good people, but they carry the soot of the world with them. Their hands and their hearts are stained with the grime of laboring in a world pol-luted by greed, prejudice, dishonesty, violence, and cynicism. Review for Religious As if in a retreat in preparation for the work of the kingdom, the disciples notice the warmth of pure love between Jesus and his mother. The home at Nazareth serves as a chapel of adoration, of deep devotion, where the love that the graced human spirit is capable of becomes visible. In Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 relating with Mary, there is no hardness of heart, no defensiveness, no secrecy, no inse-curity. The disciples could not have resisted being affected by the goodness of this mother and this Son. Long before Mary and John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence on Calvary, Jesus is already drawing his friends into Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s universal moth-erhood. At the same time, Mary quietly rejoices as she watches the glow of Trinitarian communion dawn in the lives of others. As the church begins to form, Mary joy-fully waits at the center to share what she has received. Eucharistic nuances continue to pervade Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dis-cipleship of her Son, especially in her loyal, fearless par-ticipation in his death and resurrection. The full meaning of the Via Crucis opens up before people who contem-plate it with Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent to the angel at the annunciation reaches its climax in her yes beneath the cross, where her heart, united with her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, is in perfect obedience to the Father. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obedience is not a horrified resignation to the inevitable, nor a resentful passivity in the face of something she desperately wants to alter. Mary cooperates in the sacrifice of Jesus. Indeed, as Jesus struggles toward the altar of the cross, Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirit accompanies him with the prayer that nothing dis-suade him from his g0al. Whatever dark lies, taunts, or tortuous subtleties the tempter hurled at him in Gethsemane, Mary, in luminous contrast, gently urges him not to give up. Her intense love for Jesus cannot wish him to be other than who he is. In her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s selfless desire to give himself away out of love, amid the hor-rific brutality of Calvary, Mary gazes upon the heart of 64.4 200Y Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation the Trinity revealed in human history. Wondrously graced, she embraces both the incomparable grief of a woman who witnesses her son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s execution and the awe of one who witnesses a compassion as vast as God him-self. Jesus gives forth his last breath, every last spark of energy in his being. For humaniv ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake he surrenders to Mary embraces both the incomparable grief of a woman who Witnesses her son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s execution and the awe of one: who witnesses a compassion as vast as God himself. the Father all that he has and is, and Mary watches the birth of a New Covenant. In her excruciating sorrow there is an unshak-able joy. What can possibly convey the significance of her tears shed that day? Hers are tears of pain and also over-whelming delight at a mystery so profound it takes an eternity to contemplate it. Mary does not impede or resist the cross of her Son. She lives and moves in the Spirit of the Father who hands over his beloved Son. Mary deeply comprehends the Trinity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sacrificial love. She is the first human being to understand all that the Eucharistic sacrifice entails. Even more incredible, she prays for everyone to have the courage to approach the sacrifice of Jesus and with her to desire its fulfill-ment in a personal assent to Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 self-offering. The Eucharist derives its meaning and power from Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pas-sion, death, and resurrection. Mary teaches the church how to adore the Lord at the foot of the cross, where blood and water flowed from the Savior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pierced side. Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disciples, even his closest friends, had to learn of Review for Religious the empty tomb before their despair turned to hope, but Mary is deeply consoled even as she cradles Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lifeless body in her arms. The resurrection and Pentecost show the redeeming power of the paschal mystery. So do present-day Eucharists. They do it not simply because Christ died on the cross, but because he lives now and forever, some-thing our faith knows. Through her deep faith Mary is already disposed for Easter before her risen Son ever appears. For the faithful woman who can see more than loss and emptiness at Calvary, there is more than the silence of the grave. There is a confident communion with the Father, whose unwavering love Mary knows well. Her soul has felt the tender power of the Spirit bringing to birth what human imagination cannot fathom. Mary has learned well to trust in more than what her senses reveal. She is the authentic contemplative, familiar with the Spirit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement, and it is not a spirit of despair. She remains a mother in those dark hours. She consoles and encourages the confused, disheartened disciples until the Paraclete fills their hearts with the light of Truth and with Pentecostal fire. Deep faith in the Risen One sees more than any eyes can see. It sees that death itself is not the tragic loss it appears to be, but is the last measure of the prelude to the divine oratorio of eternal life. In the Eucharist, too, participants see and hear more than their senses per-ceive. The bread is no longer bread, the wine no longer wine, but the living presence of Jesus Christ, who makes of his members a living communion. It is Mary who leads the church to the Eucharistic Lord. Hers is no mere external presence or observance or performance. She is intimately involved in her Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for the world. Her heart comes to us with the Love that overflows the heart of God. 64.4 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rafferty \\xc2\\xaf Mary, Woman of the Eucharist: A Contemplation Sources Pope John Paul II.

Review for Religious ERNEST E. LARKIN From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation T~nPaper is a bit of narrative theology, something y personal journey over the last twenty-five or thirty years trying to practice meditation and contem-plation. My account begins in midstream of my religious life, in the mid 1970s, with my introduction to centering prayer. Basically the journey has been from centering and centering prayer to Christian Meditation, the prayer discipline of John Main (+1982). Three Ways to the Center First, the point of departure. What do I mean by cen-tering and centering prayer? These .terms have become familiar and clearly defined today. It was not always so. Centering and centering prayer meant different things to different people in the 1960s and 1970s. An example is the article by Thomas E. Clarke sJ in the British journal The Way titled \\\\\"Finding Grace at the Centre.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 The title may be familiar, because it named a collection of Ernest E. Larkin OCarm wrote for us last in July-August 2003. His address is St. Agnes Catholic Church\",\"1954 North 24th Street\",\"Phoenix, Arizona 85008. 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation essays on centering prayer published by the Trappists in 1978 and again by Skylight Paths Publishing in 2002. The whole article was reprinted except for the last two pages, which at the time represented one of the chief contributions of the article. So I have a quarrel with the editors for deleting the pages and not indicating they did so. Apparently they wanted to highlight the one form of centering prayer they were espousing in the booklet, and so dropped two other prayer forms that Clarke was presenting as ways to the center. In the article Clarke presented a philo-sophical exposition of centering and then posed the ques-tion: How does one make the journey to the center? His answer was threefold. The first way was classical center-ing prayer, the way of dark faith, which proceeds beyond images and concepts and seeks to rest in the indwelling God. The other two ways to the center used imagination and feelings\",\"they were the prayer of images and fantasy and the practice of the examen of consciousness. All three were ways to the center, ways to dispose the soul for the great gift of contemplation. Together they offered a rich and broadly based prayer life. Teachers of centering prayer should have applauded the connecting of centering prayer with other forms of active prayer. Centering prayer is contemplative in intent, but active in method, as are all forms of meditation. Centering prayer was not supposed to replace lectio div-ina, nor to become one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total prayer life. Centering prayer is a spiritual exercise to deepen one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whole spir-itual life, animating, for example, the liturgy and one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devotions. Connecting the three ways put flesh and blood on centering prayer by acknowledging that imagination and human effort can help in the process of centering. Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paper stated a simple and even obvious fact, Review for Religious namely, that the search for contemplation, especially in beginnings, is not an abstract act\",\"it invokes images and thoughts even while it strives to get beyond them. All three ways converge to the center. This was a welcome reminder in the early days of centering prayer. I remember how the insight thrilled me. I talked about the distinctions with Father John Kane, a Redemptorist, who founded a contemplative house of prayer in Tucson, Arizona. We both agreed that the article was a breakthrough because it made room for the imagination at least in the beginnings of con-templative prayer. The search for contemplation was not restricted to forced abstract search\",\"one did not have to empty the mind. Centering prayer was one way to contemplation and a good way, but it was not the only way. Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s article contextualized the search for contemplation and freed it from a one-track pursuit based on theoretical textbook definitions. Before this time I had a philosophically correct but pastorally deficient understanding of contemplation as imageless prayer. I thought \\\\\"Ignatian contemplation,\\\\\" for example, which consists in reliving a gospel story, was a misnomer\",\"the process was meditation, not con-templation. I did not cotton to Morton Kelsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis that the imagination ruled the prayer practice in the church in the first millennium, and that abstract con-templation in the mode of John of the Cross was Johnny-come- lately in the second millennium. Kelsey argued this position in his popular The Other Side of Silence. To my mind, contemplation had no room for images\",\"they Have we had a philosophically correct but pastorally deficient understanding of contemplation as imageless prayer? 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation belonged to discursive prayer, the way of meditation, which was a lesser species of mental prayer. But here was Tom Clarke connecting the imagination with centering, thereby broadening horizons in contemplative prayer. The three ways of centering were a significant help to me. Two years earlier, in 1975, I had made a thirty-day Ignatian retreat and came away with the resolution to spend an hour each morning in mental prayer. I was faithful to the hour, but I lacked method. My prayer was amorphous. I read and reflected, I pondered, mused, stirred affections, and made resolutions. I also centered and sat for long periods of silence. But there was no particular order in my pondering. After two years of struggle to be faithful to the hour without a clear methodology, my prayer had became dry and difficult. I \\\\\"white-knuckled\\\\\" my prayer, holding on to the bench to fill out the hour. All this may have been a species of the determinada determinacion of Teresa of Avila, but it was probably closer to the \\\\\"zelus sine scientia corruit\\\\\" of St. Bernard: \\\\\"Zeal without knowledge destroys.\\\\\" How long could I hold on? Only the grace of God kept me from giving up on the hour. My efforts in the hour were the same as my practice in the two daily periods of formal meditation in my Carmelite community over the years. These two peri-ods were shorter, usually a half hour each, and I was able to handle them, though somewhat haphazardly. Because they were amorphous, I subsequently looked on them disparagingly. I thought I had wasted a lot of time in my mental prayer. I do not think that way now. I have come to take a more benign view. I realize with Woody Allen that ninety-five percent of life as well as of prayer is showing up. If we are there, putting in time with the Lord, the Lord will do the rest. We should not exag-gerate the role of method. Review for Retigious But method helps. The three ways of Tom Clarke supplied a format for my contemplative prayer. I would do twenty minutes of classical centering prayer, twenty minutes of reflection on the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s readings, and then after Mass twenty minutes ofjournaling. I did not char-acterize the imaginative parts of my prayer--the biblical meditation and consciousness examen--as contempla-tive, but I saw them as part of my pursuit of contempla-tion. Moreover, the active prayers gave permission for elements of imagination to enter my centering prayer. At this time I made a study of the prayer of St. Teresa of Avila in her early premystical years to determine how she employed the imagination in her beginning con-templative prayer.2 She later called this \\\\\"practice of prayer\\\\\" active recollection. In the paper I argued that the imagination played a significant role in her practice. Her prayer was her own making, hence active in form\",\"but it was contemplative since her whole effort was to rest in the deep personal realization of the Divine Indwelling. This was her whole prayer. Teresa called it \\\\\"re-presenting Christ within.\\\\\" Commentators sometimes incorrectly interpret this phrase to mean the imagina-tive recall of some mystery in Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, such as of his being scourged at the pillar. The imaginative recall is part of the prayer, but not its heart, since the recall is only the refocusing of the person in moments of wan-dering. The remembrance of an image from the passion serves the same function as the holy word in centering prayer. The holy word does not detract from the con-templative character of centering prayer any more than the image in active recollection. I concluded my paper on Teresa by saying that her prayer was a mixture of imageless and imaged centering prayer. Today I agree that the term centering prayer should be reserved to the prayer of imageless dark faith. 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 3,60 This primary thrust, however, leaves room for some imagination in the practice of this prayer. Teresa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active recollection, which can rightly be called centering prayer, was both apophatic, that is, beyond imagining and thinking, and kataphatic, that is, with a role for the imagination. These insights into Teresa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer confirmed Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion and allowed me to accept a minor but real role for the imag-ination in my own practice and theorizing about con-templative prayer. As late as the year 2000, I was still experimenting with a role for the imagination in my contemplative prayer. I was on another long retreat at the Camaldolese monastery at Big Sur in California. For five weeks I prac-ticed Christian Meditation several times each day. I described three different experiences of my contempla-tive prayer in an article in Review for Religious in 2001.3 Two of the patterns I reported engaged the imagination to a small extent. These points about the imagination and contemplation are not irrelevant\",\"they continue to occupy the attention of writers.4 The Move to Christian Meditation The centering and centering prayer so far described were the focus of my efforts at daily mental prayer for some fifteen years. I did not, however, practice it twice daily as was specified by Contemplative Outreach under the leadership of Thomas Keating. The two periods of twenty to thirty minutes, morning and evening, are essential for the discipline of centering prayer. These periods are catalysts for one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer life. They are like workouts in a physical-health regimen, and their role is to bring one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to a deeper level in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirit. The outcome is the goal of contemplation in Carmelite terminology. Review for Religious In the mid 1990s I switched my prayer practice to Christian Meditation, a similar but different form of cen-tering developed by John Main, an Irish Benedictine from England. I did so mainly because I was not satisfied with my practice of classical centering prayer. Christian Meditation is promoted by the World Community for Christian Meditation, headed by Laurence Freeman OSB. The major difference between centering prayer and Christian Meditation is the holy word versus the mantra. \\\\\"Holy word\\\\\" and \\\\\"mantra\\\\\" are not synonyms. Their dif-ference specifies the two forms of contemplative prayer. Christian Meditation repeats the mantra, usually the biblical prayer \\\\\"ma-ra-na-tha,\\\\\" which means \\\\\"Come, Lord,\\\\\" from the begin-ning to the end of the prayer. The holy word, on the other hand, is not repeated continu-ously, but only as needed to renew the consent to the Divine Presence. The holy word expresses the will of the person to rest quietly, silently, in the Lord. The mantra, on the other hand, carries the prayer. John Main does not tire of saying that the mantra is the prayer. It creates the silence that is emptiness and open-ness before God, the silence that invites the Divine Presence. The mantra nurtures the beatitude \\\\\"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God\\\\\" (Mt 5:8). Purity of heart and contemplation are the two hinges of the door of the mantra. The mantra is not magic, but a simple device to shut down ordinary rational activity in favor of silence. How would we explain the major difference between centering prayer and Christian Meditation as the holy word versus the mantra? 361 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 362 Since I switched my daily practice to Christian Meditation ten years ago, I have been faithful to the two times each day. My personal preference for Christian Meditation is not a condemnation of centering prayer\",\"the same fruits and benefits are available in both forms. The choice of one or other of the two disciplines is a personal matter. I feel that centering prayer has a closer affinity with Teresa of Avila than with John of the Cross and that Christian Meditation has a closer affinity with John than with Teresa. I base these opinions on the sim-ilarity between active recollection and centering prayer, and a similarity of absolutes between the nada and the todo in John and the call to kenosis or self-emptying in Christian Meditation. In the final analysis the two approaches are more alike than different. For this reason I have studied them together and emphasized what is common to them. I have published several articles on the two forms, which I hope to gather into a book. The leaders in the two movements work closely together and see their ministries as parallel. One example of this close collaboration is a prayer center in Phoenix called the Cornerstone. It is sponsored by both movements, which share the same space in a former convent in the Carmelite parish of St. Agnes. The Cornerstone offers programs that are sometimes common to both groups and sometimes specific to one of them. It is lay orga-nized and lay directed. The Genius of Christian Meditation I have come to see Christian Meditation as a com-panion piece, a \\\\\"how to\\\\\" addition to the teaching of St. John of the Cross on the passage from meditation to contemplation. This area is one of his specialties. He defines in precise terms both meditation and contem-plation and why the transition from one state to the other Review for Religious can be difficult if not traumatic. Meditation for him is a rational activity, the work of the imagination and the discursive reason\",\"it is active and self-directed. Contemplation is passive and receptive of the gift of the love and presence of God. The transition from one state to the other can be disturbing. Beginning contempla-tion may look like a step backward, even total loss. The old way of meditation is no longer appealing or even possible, and the new way of contemplation is not self-evident. The experience is the passive dark night of the senses. It is a great grace, but easily mistaken and open to misunderstanding. John gives his famous three signs to authenticate the state as well as detailed instruction on the conduct to be followed. In discursive meditation one deals with concrete indi-vidual acts, striving to remove the bad ones and to pro-mote good ones. So meditation is analyzing, evaluating, making choices and resolutions. The soul is like a win-dowpane, St. John says, and the work of meditation is to remove the smudges of bad habits and replace them with acts and habits that are bright with the light of Christ. The light of Christ is faith. The window pane is lighted up by faith-motivated activity. Over time the win-dow becomes clear and the soul purified in the matter of concrete choices. The light of faith shines through with fullness, simplicity, and wholeness. This is the light of contemplation. The light is always there, John of the Cross says. It is part of the state of grace. The perception of the light, however, is dependent on being rid of delib-erate sinful habits. John writes as follows: This light is never lacking to the soul, but, because of creature forms and veils that weigh on it and cover it, the light is never infused. If individuals would elimi-nate these impediments and veils and live in pure nakedness and poverty of spirit, as we will explain 64.4 200~ Larkin * From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 364 later, their soul in its simplicity and purity would be immediately transformed into simple and pure Wisdom, the Son of God. (Ascent 2.15.4) Thus these graces, when received, are \\\\\"infused light and love,\\\\\" that is, infused contemplation. The way of con-templation is self-awareness of this new state of being. One simply opens one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes and sees and basks in the love and presence of God. At first there will be a going back and forth between meditation and contemplation. John of the Cross gives detailed advice on how to recognize the times for the one or the other, that is, when to continue to meditate and when to rest in the contemplative light and love. His teaching is renowned for its clarity and effectiveness for spiritual direction and retains its place in the life of every budding contemplative. But it is a complicated teaching. Along comes John Main who sees meditation and contemplation in conti-nuity with each other and as one process. The prayer or discipline of Christian Meditation is one dynamic that begins with the mantra and stays with it through multi-ple experiences of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love. Contemplation is the awareness of Abba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for me, who am bonded with the Son in the love of the Holy Spirit. The contemplative grows in the appreciation of this love and gets ever more deeply in touch with the knowledge and love that the Tr!nity showers on the world. There is communio, koinonia, participation in the reality of God and his cre-ation. This communion is unitive knowledge, of subject and subject inhering in each other. It is not dualistic knowledge, from the outside, leaving subject and object apart from one another. It is not any particular psycho-logical experience. There is at-oneness, a \\\\\"common union\\\\\" or communion, in which the Trinity and the human being enter into what Teresa of Avila called Review for Religious union, namely, \\\\\"two things becoming one.\\\\\" Communion is the ontological reality\",\"contemplation adds awareness and attention. Not every experience of Christian Meditation is infused contemplation such as John of the Cross has in mind. But every experience is communion and eventually will bring the fullness of contemplation. The commitment to Christian Meditation is a com-mitment to a way of life. The way is always the same\",\"it is the way of the mantra from beginning to end. The goal of the prayer is without limits. One stops saying the mantra only when one is reduced to silence. These are moments of special grace that John of the Cross calls \\\\\"oblivion\\\\\" (Living Flame 3.3 5). One resumes saying the mantra as soon as the silence is recognized, because that is the sign that the special mystical grace has passed. John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program is one of utter simplicity. He does not stress, though he may acknowledge in theory, the abstract differences between meditation and con-templation or the different degrees of contemplation. But he treats them as one spiritual practice and says explicitly that meditation, meditative prayer, contem-plation, and contemplative prayer are all synonyms. No need to be concerned about essences, he seems to say\",\"the important thing is to grow in purity of heart and recep-tivity to divine grace. The journey is the same in both John of the Cross and John Main, but it is described from different viewpoints. The older John presents objective theology in the manner of the scholastics\",\"the younger John has made the turn to the subject, and his exposition is experiential and practical. Laurence Freeman remarks that John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose was to start people on the journey and let experience of the prayer teach the rest. The one task proposed is the mantra. The mantra does not deal with obstacles one by one or even supply building blocks for a spiritual edi- 64.4 2005 Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation 566 rice. It silences the mind, emptying it of its contents. The silence makes room for the Spirit to take over. \\\\\"Be,\\\\\" says John Main,\\\\\" and you are in the Spirit.\\\\\"s The Spirit is already there with Father and Son in the Divine Indwelling. If the soul is silent and receptive, the Spirit will pray there beyond images and thoughts, in sighs too deep for words (Rm 8:26). The Spirit will do this because the soul is open and ready and God wants that mutual indwelling even more than the soul does who is sincerely seeking God. John Main\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple method frees the person so that the presence of the Trinity can come alive and be actualized. When there is space and freedom, the meditator is caught up in the prayer of Jesus. That prayer is the one and only prayer in the world since the Incarnation, because it is the love between Father and Son and envelops all of creation. Faithful meditators are woven into that salvit]c love. The journey with the Son to the Father will traverse the stages of Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Christian Meditation will be the vehicle, the discipline to get one going and to help one stay on the path. These are astounding claims for Christian Meditation. Their jus-tification is the beatitude \\\\\"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God\\\\\" (Mt 5:8). The silence of the mantra produces the purity of heart, and the reward of purity of heart is the love of God, of people, and of the world found in the gift of contemplation. How does silence accomplish this twofold task? By allowing one to escape from the false self by placing one beyond the toils of ego and the world it creates, by free-ing one from the imprisonment of false desires. This healing produces purity of heart. The new freedom allows one to go deeper into the spirit, the domain of the Trinity. The reality of this state is primary and comes before awareness and appreciation. The reality is called Review for Religious communio or participation in the life of God\",\"the aware-ness is contemplation. The Spirit will give us contem-plation when we are ready. Contemplation is thus the outcome of faithful prac-tice of the mantra. Contemplation is the life of God received, the backdrop and engine of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whole spiri-tual life. It is the life that animates one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community rela-tionships, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ministry, and one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer. The short definition is the realization of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love for us, \\\\\"the love of God poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given us\\\\\" (Rm 5:5). Contemplation is the outcome of a faithful life. It means claiming what was there from the beginning. It is the Abba experience of Jesus. In his human life Jesus was filled with the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and love. Certain events like the baptism or the transfiguration were climactic experiences of that love, but Jesus abided in that love always. He looked out upon the world bathed in the Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love. He was the \\\\\"beloved Son,\\\\\" and in him the reign of God was estab-lished on the earth. That reign is the kingdom of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and love. It is the resurrection experience. It fills the world with the grandeur of God. Christian Meditation promises this contemplation. Each practice will not necessarily bring forth a recog-nizable, reflexive experience of that love. But every exer-cise will put one a little more in touch with it and will be an experience of communion, of koinonia, of participation in that love. Transformation is taking place, slowly, incre-mentally, and the Christian is being formed in the Wisdom of God, the Son of God, in whom we live and move and have our being. Christian Meditation can indeed be one practical response of meditation and con-templation in our troubled times. 64.4 200Y Larkin \\xc2\\xaf From Centering Prayer to Christian Meditation Notes 1 Way 17 (1977): 12-22. 2 \\\\\"Teresa of Avila and Centering Prayer,\\\\\" in Carmelite Studies 3 (Washington, D.C.: ICS Publications, 1984), pp. 203-209. 3 \\\\\"An Experience of Christian Meditation,\\\\\" Review for Religious 60 (2001): 419-431. 4 See, for example, Brian V.

SAMMON Rekindling the Fire: Vocation Efforts Dear Brothers and all who cherish the charism of Marcellin Champagnat, It is early morning here in Rome. The last guests from Saturday evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vigil celebration of the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feast have departed, the house is quiet, and the first hours of a new day are just beginning to unfold. What better time than the dawn of St. Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day to begin a letter to you about the awakening of vocations to his Little Brothers of Mary. Please join me in this continuing effort, this continuing prayer. Like so many of you, I believe that God continues to move the hearts of young people and call them to a variety of voca-tions within our church. So let us pledge to do our best to foster their generous response, while concentrating our efforts on those called to our way of life and mission as Little Brothers of Mary. After all, our Marist Constitutions and Sefin D. Sammon FMS, superior general of the Marist Brothers, writes again in epistolary form. His address is Fratelli Maristi delle Scuole\",\"C.P. 10250\",\"00144 Roma, Italy. calling 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire Statutes reminds us that to do so is a sign of our vitality as an institute. 3:70 Awakening Vocations Well-designed publications, attractive posters, lively and thoughtful presentations that deal with our life and ministry are all ways of cultivating vocations. They all help young people, their parents, and our church to have a better sense of who we are and what we do, and espe-cially to learn something about what we cherish and hold dear. When all is said and done, however, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it actually the lives of thousands of brothers over the almost two-hundred- year history of our institute that are our most effective means to awaken vocations? And so your voca-tional tale and mine are good places to start if we want to understand more fully just what we are trying to do. It does no harm to ask ourselves from time to time what first brought us to the life of a Little Brother of Mary and what keeps us here. My own story began when I met the small group of brothers who staffed the high school I attended in the heart of New York City. Even with the distance of years, I can still remember what it was about those men that captured my imagination and my heart. They were obvi-ously religious people, and they appeared happy in their work together and in their commitment to it. There was a spirit of sacrifice among them that somehow appealed to my adolescent soul. And there was passion. This element is at the heart of any vocation worth its salt. Though I may not have rec-ognized it at the time, I realize now that there were some very passionate men in that small group of brothers. In retrospect I can see that, in their love for Jesus Christ and his Good News and for us their students, they shared with us some of the very qualities that our founder Review for Religious inspired in the young men we know today as Francois, Laurent, Jean-Baptiste, Dominique, and Louis-Marie. Even now I find myself surprised at how subtly God was at work in my life, though I surely would never have used that language when I was fourteen. I have to say that I was blessed early in life to meet those men who took delight in helping a rather uncivi-lized crowd of young men to grow up and grow closer to God. These men--many were young themselves--were willing to waste time on us. Time, it was their only currency, and they shared it with us freely and gen-erously. During the years since then, perhaps in imitation or through the mystery of grace, some of my happiest moments have been with young people, sharing their world, their hopes and dreams, their fears and concerns, their ques-tions of faith. Vocation promotion :should neVer be undertaken solely for survival. Vocations for Mission and Not Survival Vocation promotion should never be .undertaken solely for survival. Nor is it simply a matter of numbers. Numbers are not necessarily a sign of viability, nor is age the best measure of vitality. Our zeal for mission, then, rather than a desire to survive \\\\\"come what may,\\\\\" must be our reason for awakening vocations. This tradition goes back to Father Champagnat. The ever unfolding tale of our institute records that Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit to the bedside of a dying teenager is what persuaded him to found a com-munity of brothers with this aim: to proclaim God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News to poor children and young people. We know the story well. Discovering that Jean-Baptiste Mongagne knew \\xc2\\xaf \\\\\" 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire nothing about his faith, Marcellin instructed him, admin-istered what were then called \\\\\"the last sacraments,\\\\\" and went on his way. Returning a short while later, he dis-covered that the lad had died. I have often wondered about our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts and feelings as he returned home to Lavalla that evening. We can imagine his pace quickening. We know that almost immediately upon his arrival he met Jean-Marie Granjon, who had been a grenadier in Napoleon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army. Picture their conversation taking place on the bridge near what today is the Hermitage. For Marcellin the mission was clear, the reasons for founding a commu-nity of brothers evident. As they talked on that bridge, our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion convinced the former soldier to join him and give his heart to a corporate adventure soon to be known as the Little Brothers of Mary. Marcellin loved the children and young people of his day. More than once he said, \\\\\"l cannot see children with-out wanting to tell them how much Jesus Christ loves them, and how much I love them.\\\\\" In today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world many children and young people are the victims of war, human trafficking, and the streets. Denied an education and other basic human rights, they are in desperate need of hearing God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News. And so, I ask you, do you believe as I do that the mission of our institute is as urgent today as it was in Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day, and that it will remain so for the foreseeable future? If you do, then let us agree that the awakening of new vocations can no longer be a sideline attraction for you or for me. Instead, we need to develop a plan for promoting vocations and then put that plan into action. A First Set of Challenges A few challenges before we go on. First, a challenge to my brothers in the institute. If you and I want to make Review for Religious vocation promotion a top priority, most if not all of us will need to arrange our other commitments so as to free up twenty percent of our best time for that work. Why twenty percent? Because there is a lot to learn and a great deal of work to be done. We can all beg off, citing good reasons not to get involved. Lack of time, the demands of ministry, age--who among us has not heard that litany before? But, if you and I want a future for the mission and life of our institute, we need to avoid making excuses and, instead, commit ourselves enthusi-astically to promoting vocations. And now a word to my lay partners. I ask you to join us in our efforts to educate parents, the young people in your care and ours, and the church at large about who we Little Brothers of Mary are, what our life is, and what our ministries are. You know us and know what we cher-ish and hold dear. Help others come to know us as you do. And help us, too, by inviting young people to con-sider making our way of life their own. I have no hesi-tation in asking you to give these efforts top priority. All who share our founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism should eagerly promote vocations to the brotherhood he established. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good News remains to be proclaimed to more children and young people than we might imagine. And what happens if all of us--brothers and lay part-ners alike--decide not to make vocation promotion a major concern and not to give enough time to this impor-tant ministry? What are the consequences? Some would say that a failure to act and act decisively would dimin-ish the probability of a vital and vibrant future for our way of life and ministry. Others would be harsher. If we fail to act, they would tell us, we probably do not deserve a future. In 1822 Marcellin Champagnat faced a vocation cri-sis, the first in the history of our institute. And how did 373 64.4 200~ Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire he respond? By taking action, beginning with his pil-grimage to the chapel of Our Lady of Pity. We do well today to follow his example. Today more than a few peo-ple use the term vocation culture to describe an environ-ment in which a call or vocation can take root and flourish. You and I can foster such a culture by believing that vocations to Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Little Brothers of Mary exist today and that with God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace and our human efforts we can find and cultivate them. A Pastoral Plan for Awakening Vocations A pastoral plan to awaken vocations can help us awaken vocations to our way of life and ministry. A num-ber of provinces and districts already have a well- A ,pastoral: p!an to awaken vocations can help Us awaken, vocations to our way of life and ministry: designed plan in place. Time will tell of its effec-tiveness. Other provinces and districts can take time or make time to develop a plan. The plan should be comprehensive and include in its details the province or district, all the mem-bers, each community, and every ministry--and, of course, all the others who share Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism and want to help promote vocations. In drawing up any plan, you and I are better off con-centrating on what can be done rather than lamenting things we cannot change. In some parts of the world, for example, families are smaller than in the past, young people have far more vocational options to consider, and they may make their life commitments at a later age. Neither you nor I can do much to alter these realities. We can, though, invite young men to our way of life and ministry once again, and we can open our homes and Review for Religious hearts to them. We can also help them and others to understand all that has happened in religious life and in our institute during the forty years since Vatican Council II. Let us do what we can, and not keep wringing our hands about what we cannot change. In making plans we must be sure they are adapted to the culture in which we live. A universal pastoral plan for vocations is unrealistic. Differences exist between regions, and customs vary. What is quite acceptable in one part of our world is looked upon with suspicion in another. And so I offer below just a few ideas to get your thinking started. Be as creative as you can. And do not forget to include in the plan exactly whatyou plan to do personally. a. Province or District Provinces and districts should have at least one full-time vocation promoter, but everyone should promote vocations. The full-time promoter should help the oth-ers to do what they can. There should be a well-designed program that explains contemporary religious life to lay men and women. Some of our brothers will tell you that they feel shaken by the changes in our way of life during the last four decades. In that case, just imagine how shaken the average Catholic may be. In some countries, for example, people feel betrayed and confused about why we no longer staff the local school and do not live in the brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house next to the church. A good program could clarify the reasons behind such changes. It could also show that everyone--the laity, bishops and priests, and men and women religious themselves--has a respon-sibility for recruiting new members for religious con-gregations. Some among these groups appear reluctant to do so. I cannot help believing that such reluctance may stem from a lack of understanding about our life today. Catholic parents deserve special attention. At one 64.4 2005 Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire 376[ time they were great allies of ours in awakening voca-tions. Today many parents are confused about religious life, about why and how people are still living it. Where their trust has been eroded, we must work to restore it and enlist their aid once again. Our program could include offering an adult educa-tioncourse in a local parish, or as in-service training for faculties in our schools, or as part of parent-teacher con-ferences, or as an Advent or Lenten series. Some could write articles for their parish bulletin or diocesan news-paper. Others could say a few words during or at the end of Mass on Sunday. The means are not quite as impor-tant as the message: our life and mission as brothers is alive and well and ready to receive new members. The work described above could be coordinated by the full-time province vocation promoter. He should not, however, take on these tasks for a local community sim-ply because its members do not want to. His time is bet-ter spent persuading them that the tasks mentioned are rightly theirs and that they have the resources to accom-plish them. Finally, the media and the internet, where avai]able, have great potential to awaken vocations. Where a province web page exists, the vocation pro-moter should make sure that the topic of vocations appears on it and is effectively presented. b. Local Communities Local communities have many opportunities to pro-mote vocations. First of all, though, they should as a group agree to a common plan that ensures that their work will be effective and that nothing will be uselessly duplicated. Prayer must be part of any community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. Along with this, three or four times a year a community might invite groups of young people from their school or parish to an open house that is focused on religious life. Such a visit, particularly if it is well planned, can com- Review for Religious municate more about religious life than a series of lec-tures would. Another community might invite parishioners of all ages for a time of prayer, some refreshments, and some friendly conversation, particularly about religious voca-tions. Many people are willing and ready to participate and help, but they need to be asked. A brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involve-ment in a parish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s youth ministry program can be the occasion for young people to learn more about broth-ers and their life. Lay people involved in youth ministry, especially if they know us well, can also raise the topic or answer questions the young may have about religious life. A community might also arrange to print a pamphlet describing our life and mission and place it in the vestibule of the local parish church. In places where the local newspaper or television station does human-inter-est pieces, one or two members of the community could commit themselves to write an article or be interviewed about our life and ministry. c. Our Works Visibility! That should be the yardstick for measur-ing efforts to promote vocations in the institutions where we serve. Posters, pamphlets, days set aside to present the history, life, and mission of the Little Brothers of Mary--all these should be regular fare in any school or social-service project in which we are involved. Our col-leagues and those whom we serve should know clearly just what it means to be one of Marcellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brothers. While being happily aware that our schools, parishes, and agencies touch others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives well beyond themselves, we must not overlook those with whom we share min-istry. There may, for example, be lay faculty members in our schools who have given thought, to religious life and our life in particular, but just do not know how to [377 64.4 200Y Sammon \\xc2\\xaf Rekindling the Fire 378 bring up the subject. We should make sure that oppor-tunities exist to discuss the matter, and that they exist in abundance. d. Each Brother and Lay Partner If you asked me to suggest one thing that you as indi-viduals could do to promote vocations, I would answer immediately: Invite young men that you know to think about making our life and ministry their own. Such an invitation by a brother is the factor mentioned most often by young persons and by those further along in years as well. So I say to my brothers: Awaken vocations, find persons who in good time can replace yourselves. And to my lay partners I say: Awaken vocations so as to ensure a vibrant partnership between brothers and yourselves. Without enough brothers, partnership with you is not possible. To all, I offer this reminder: Personal prayer is most important. So pray for those who have religious life on their minds. Pray for them daily. Pray for them by name. If writing is your gift, put it to good use by writing about our life and mission. And if music, or art, or the media world is your passion, use it to awaken vocations. Teach about our life if teaching is your talent\",\"encourage vocations if your gift is to motivate people. Above all, be creative in planning to awaken vocations. Keep asking yourselves how to use your God-given skills to promote vocations. Give twenty percent of your best time to the effort, and do not forget to invite. Blessings and affection, Se~in D. Sammon FMS Superior General Review for Religious Reflection Questions 1) Spend some time thinking about young people that you know. They might be members of your family, the children of friends, students, those with whom you work in ministry, young people in the parish, or elsewhere. Once you have spent some time thinking about the young people in your life, please turn your attention to the questions below. 1. What is it that you most admire about the emerging generation? Take a moment to explain your answer more fully. 2. What is it about the young people you know that most baffles you? Once again, please take a moment to explain. 3. What qualities do you look for in a young man today when considering candidates for our Marist brother-hood? 2) Spend some time thinking about what you might do individually to awaken vocations during this year ahead. What skills can you bring to the task, what will be helpful to young people, particularly those with an interest in our Institute, how can you best convey the many dimensions of our life rather than one or another? Yes, take some time to pray, seek to understand what God is asking of you this year in terms of awakening vocations, and then turn your attention to the ques-tions below. 1. As you look ahead to the coming year, what steps will you take personally to awaken Vocations? 2. What will you do the first month, during the first three months, during the first half of the year? 3. Is there a way you can combine your efforts with oth-ers to have even greater .influence awakening vocations during this time of grace? Please explain. 64.4 2005 LEO J. HERIOT Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth 380[ Jr~hn Paul II\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apostolic exhortation on religious life minded us religious of our founders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 charisms and what they offer to us, their followers: \\\\\"Consecrated per-sons live Jbr God and from God, and precisely for this reason they are able to bear witness to the reconciling power of grace, which overcomes the divisive tenden-cies present in the human heart and in society\\\\\" (Vita con-secrata 41). And in the same vein we have words that mean much to persons consecrated to a mission: \\\\\"In the image of Jesus, the beloved Son \\xe2\\x80\\x99whom the Father con-secrated and sent into the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 those whom God calls to follow him are also consecrated and sent into the world to imitate his example and to continue his mis-sion\\\\\" (VC 72). The young John Bosco, the son of Francis and Margherita Bosco of Becchi in Turin, had a unique expe-rience at the age of nine, and we can think his mission Leo J. Heriot SDB lectures in Salesian history and also teaches pas-toral psychology and Scripture in Moamoa Theological College\",\"P.O. Box 9226\",\"Apia, Western Samoa. Review for Religious took root at this very time. He had a strange but com-pelling dream, and this dream would return to him often and remind him of this mission of his. Each vocation is unique, and each calling is special, but for God to call a boy of nine and show him his mission in symbolic form is very special. He told about his dream in his own terms, couched in his own plain language, but it seems that the Lord was surely present in it: When I was about nine years old I had a dream that left a profound impression on me for the rest of my life. I dreamed that I was near my home, in a very large playing field where a crowd of children were having fun. Some were laughing, some playing, and not a few cursing. I was so shocked at their language that I jumped into their midst, swinging wildly with my arms and shouting at them to stop. At that moment a man appeared, nobly dressed, with an imposing appearance. He was dressed in white, and his face radi-ated such light that I could not look directly at him. He called me by name. \\\\\"John,\\\\\" he said, \\\\\"you will have to win over these boys of yours not with punches, but with gentleness and kindness. So now begin to show them that sin is ugly and virtue is attractive.\\\\\" At this stage John said, \\\\\"I am still only a boy. How can I influence these children for the better?\\\\\" But the man of his dream told him that he was to change these boys by acquiring knowledg~ and being obedient to the Lord. As the young John watched, he saw these boys change into goats, dogs, cats, bears, and a variety of other animals. The person of his dream told him, \\\\\"This is your field where you must work, and to carry out your task you must become humble, steadfast, and strong!\\\\\" As he looked again, he saw these wild animals change into lambs. In his confusion John Bosco asked the majestic lady who appeared next to him to explain the meaning of this strange thing in his life. She told him, \\\\\"In time 381 64.4 200~ Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth When he was ordained a priest on 5 June 1841, he wondered what his future work would be. 382 everything will be made clear to you, and you will under-stand your apostolate.\\\\\" The next morning during breakfast John told his dream. His brothers scoffed at his simplicity, and every-one, including his mother and grandmother, had differ-ent explanations for this dream. Joseph, his older brother, said he would become a sheep farmer, and Anthony, his step-brother, told him he would probably become the leader of gang of robbers. His mother suggested that he might become a priest, and his wise old grandmother told him not to take any notice of dreams!. This dream when he was nine influenced John Bosco all his life. His apostolate and his system of education would be based on the reflections of this dream. When he was ordained a priest on 5 June 1841, with little or no fuss about the ordination, he wondered what his future work would be and how he was supposed to achieve the mission planned for him when he was a little boy. He was offered one or another parish or chaplaincy in Turin. Uncertain of his choice, he went to his spiritual director, Father Joseph Cafasso, and placed before him the various proposals. Strange as it may seem, his guide told him to go to the Convitto Ecdesiastico, a residential center where priests studied spirituality and moral the-ology according to the teaching of St. Alphonsus Liguori. It was not an academic institute so much as a pastoral center w.here a lecture was given morning and evening and the rest of the day was taken up with priestly min-istrations to people in prison, to families in their neigh-borhoods, and to patients in hospitals, especially the Review for Religious hospice founded by Canon Cottolengo (now St. Joseph Benedict Cottolengo). Later on, Don Bosco would write about his experience in this clerical convitto: \\\\\"Here I learned what it means to be a priest.\\\\\" Turin in the 1840s was a town filled with young per-sons looking for work. There had been a drought for a number of years, and poverty in the villages had forced many boys and young men into the town seeking employment. Employment was limited, and before long many of them were stealing food or money to survive. They were coming from Lombardy, Savoy, and as far away as Switzerland. Needless to say, with the influx of these young men, the prisons became full. In Turin there were four main prisons, and they were crowded with boys from thirteen to eighteen. Their crimes were more from necessity than malice. Don Bosco made it a point to visit these prisons, tak-ing with him bread, sweets, and tobacco. The conditions were appalling: overcrowded, unsanitary. Loudmouths and foulmouths aired their hatred when these priests came to visit. Many priests from the Convitto Ecclesiastico found it hard to visit the prisoners living in such sub-standard conditions. One described the boys in prison as caged animals, often aggressive and impervious to the kindness of friendship. In his first visit to the prison, where the juveniles were mixed together with the hard-ened men, Don Bosco was treated with disdain. Just after Easter in 1842, however, he invited some prisoners to make a retreat. His friendly concern was slowly seeping into the hearts of the detainees. Some came around, but the going remained difficult. Still, he persevered with his plans, even with the comings and goings. Boys in one prison might be released all of a sudden, perhaps only to be apprehended again and given a sentence in another prison. 383 64.4 2005 Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continuing Mission to Youth 384] The success of this retreat becomes evident in what Don Bosco managed to obtain for the boys. After the retreat he asked the official in charge, Urban Rattazzi, whether he could take the prison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s juveniles to Stupingi for a picnic. Rattazzi agreed, provided that some police-men went along. Don Bosco bargained with him for another arrangement, no policemen. At eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, .:when the prison gates opened, the guards said to one another, \\\\\"Well, this is the last we will see of some of these 260 wretches!\\\\\" But, at the roll call at the end of the day, all had returned--showing that a little bit of kindness brings out the best in the worst of children. Another of Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apostolates was in the neigh-borhoods of Turin. Industries were growing there, and on the building sites boys as young as ten or twelve were often seen lugging heavy loads of bricks and mortar on poorly erected scaffolding. Don Bosco would argue with the contractors, appealing for the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 safety. When he first went to the building sites, he would hear the boys sneering and snickering as he passed: Ecco lo prete, \\\\\"Look at the [good~for-nothing] churchman!\\\\\" He would reply, No, un sacerdote, \\\\\"No, a priest [who sacrifices and blesses].\\\\\" He would invite these young boys to his house on Sunday, and many would come for the meal and the instruction he offered them. As a matter of fact, many of these boys became his first Salesians. Don Bosco had enormous persuasive power with the young. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third apostolate in these early years of his priesthood was in Canon Cottolengo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hospice, the Little House of Divine Providence. True love was found there. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special interest was in the section dedicated to the young. Many young persons coming from villages had become the victims of syphilis and gon-orrhea. As a result of these sexually transmitted diseases, young sufferers often finished their lives in this hospice. Review for Religious Don Bosco would often put his head in his hands and say in humble prayer, \\\\\"What can I do to help these young people avoid these diseases that are symptoms of a loose society?\\\\\" One wonders whether the spirit that in the 19th cen-tury motivated St. John Bosco--founder of the Salesians and, as Pope John Paul II called him, the Father and Teacher of Youth--can be found once again in a world that seems to have forgotten the importance of heart for educating hearts. Education without love is incomplete and can only end in frustration. Compensation Foliage fallen from its color\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weight leaves emptiness in the treetops.

He was the first Catholic to be elected president. The USSR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nikita Khrushchev had already been on the cover of Time maga-zine holding Sputnik, the first successful unmanned spacecraft. Vatican Council II had completed its first session, but no documents had yet been issued. The city of Berlin in what was East Germany was divided by a massive and formidable wall that could be breached only at the risk of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. The French had recently withdrawn from Vietnam, and some of my high school classmates had already fled to Canada to avoid the military draft as American involve-ment in that war began to escalate. JFK had already experienced the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and Elizabeth McDonough OP, our Canonical Counsel colum-nist, has written a number of articles for us. She holds the Bishop Griffin Chair of Canon Law at the Pontifical College Josephinum\",\"7625 North High Street\",\"Columbus, Ohio 43235. Revie\\xe2\\x80\\x99w for Religious the Cuban missile crisis had been concluded without a nuclear war. Martin Luther King Jr. had very recendy delivered his now famous \\\\\"I have a Dream\\\\\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial. Elvis Presley had appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, the Beatles had finished their first frenzied foray into the USA, and Betty Friedan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Feminine Mystique had iust been published. Within ten weeks of my entering the convent, our nearly one hundred postulants and novices were at choir practice early on a Friday afternoon in November when we heard that JFK had been critically wounded in an assassination attempt in Dallas. We said a prayer and continued singing, unaware that he was already dead. Of the thirty-four postulants who entered the same time I did, twenty-two received the habit almost a year later. No one seemed to think it unusual that so many of the postulants who had entered nearly a year before had now departed. By the time Vatican Council II had concluded in December 1965, Malcolm X had been gunned down, and the Watts riots in Los Angeles were a matter of history. Less than two and a half years later, Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis. Riots immediately left burnt-out buildings, mounds of rubble, and shattered lives in much of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital as well as in other major cities across the country. Two months after that, in June 1968, Robert Kennedy was assassinated while cam-paigning in Los Angeles. Later that summer, antiwar riots disrupted the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. That same year, Mary Daly of Boston College published The Church and the Second Sex, and Richard Nixon, who had lost the election to JFK in 1960, became president of the United States. By July 1969, when America placed a man on the 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 388 moon, only a dozen of the original thirty-four postu-lants were still members of my religious community. One month later, on the weekend in August when I professed first vows, a three-day \\\\\"Music and Arts Festival\\\\\" was held on a rural farm in upstate New York near the small town of Woodstock. The admission price was $6 a day. The following spring, in May 1970, students at Kent State University protesting the Vietnam War were shot and killed by National Guardsmen. In that same year, for the first time in anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memory of our commu-nity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hundred and forty years of existence, no one pro-fessed first vows. The decade of the 1960s was considered by some as possibly the best of times, and by others as positively the worst of times. For American Catholic sisters, it may simply have been, on the whole, the least auspicious of times for the church to suggest that we reassess every aspect of our lives. From the vantage point of nearly half a century, it seems that Pope John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basic intent in convoking the Second Vatican Council in 1959 may have been to initi-ate a radical renewal of all of Christian life. In other words, he may have envisioned a total conversion of mind and heart on the part of all Catholics and even all Christians. It seems he may have intended to sow the seeds of a personal and collective, intellectual and voli-tional metanoia in all believers, so that what Jesus Christ bequeathed to the church might further the salvation of humanity more effectively than it had the first two thou-sand years. Recall that by January 1959, when the council was first announced, the world had just witnessed the most continuously violent, humanly devastating half century in recorded history. From his vantage point, Pope John possibly considered it high time--or time well overdue-- Review for Religious for the whole church to reassess its meaning and role and self-understanding in face of the crying needs of humanity. Recall that Vatican II was convoked before the Berlin Wall appeared almost overnight, before the Cuban mis-sile crisis, before America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seventeen-year involvement in the Vietnam War, before the multiple assassinations and urban violence of the 1960s, before humanity first looked at the world from the moon, before the first ter-rorist attack at the 1972 Olympics, and before the suc-cessful cloning of animals. The council was convoked before the resolution of South African apartheid, before Sarajevo, before Rwanda, before Pol Pot in Cambodia, before Tiananmen Square in China, before the Lockerbie crash in Scotland, before Somalia, before the Gulf War, before Oklahoma City, before Columbine, and long before 9/11. It was convoked before the Iraq War, before Darfur, before the Beslan grade school massacre, before the impact of global warming, and before the global impact of AIDS. What, indeed, we might ask, would John xxIII pos-sibly think now? Perhaps much the same as he was think-ing in 1959, namely, that the church still needs to take a genuinely new look at itself and at the rest of reality in light of the salvation wrought by Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life-death-res-urrection- ascension. Whatever any of us may think, say, hope, or regret regarding the Second Vatican Council, few even suspect that the positive potential of its origi-nal intent has yet been realized. This is in part because much more time is needed theologically and practically to assess and to internalize what it said and did. But the council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrealized potential is also, at least in part, the result, of widely divergent interpretations of its content and meaning which have been categorically co-opted and systematically disseminated by clearly dichotomous seg- 64.4 2005 McDonougb * The Coundl as Catalyst A catalyst initiates a reaction and enables to,proceed under milder conditions than otherwise possible. 390 ments of ecclesial society. For nearly four decades, both sides of this ecclesial dichotomy have consciously sus-tained their combative engagement at all levels of church life. And they have done so with an energy and efficiency that has left most Catholics exhausted and not really very much renewed at all. Meanwhile, any genuine intellectual and volitional conversion that might more effectively bring Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salvation to the complex human and spir-itual needs of our battered world has not been afforded a fair chance to begin in earnest. So it seems to me. The title of this article refers to the council as a cat-alyst. A catalyst initiates a reaction and enables it to pro-ceed under milder conditions than otherwise possible. The council did initiate a reaction. When the council began, sis-ters in my community were all known by the names given them when they entered the novitiate. This change initi-ated us into an ego-effacing formation deliberately created to foster an encompassing new way of life. All our sisters lived in convents with local superiors and did things in order of rank from old-est to youngest according to when we had made profes-sion. We all ate in silence while someone read an article or book judged by the superior to be of some signifi-cance (which was often unknown to us who listened as we ate). We all ate whatever was served, though exceptions were made for personal illness. Some sisters seemed to have some personal illness rather regularly. A few seemed to have some personal illness for as long as anyone could remember. We generally washed our own dishes \\\\\"at table\\\\\" in a large dishpan of initially clean, soapy water. Review for Religious With rare exception, we never ate at unscheduled times and never ate outside of our own refectory (our term for dining room). We all had three habits: one for Sunday, one for our everyday apostolate, and one for work. Unlike men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reli-gious communities, wherein a habit could often be con-veniently donned or doffed, our habits were the only clothes we had. They were worn at all times except when we went to bed. We were fully \\\\\"habited\\\\\" at prayer, at our apostolate, at table, when working in the garden, when doing heavy housecleaning, and even when occa-sionally sledding or playing basketball with sisters around our age during a school break. Depending on where we were stationed (that is, where we were assigned to live and work), the work we did could be teaching a class of fifty or more students, peeling bushels of fruit, running industrial laundry equip-ment, washing dishes for as many as five hundred people, using large, heavy, institutional machines to wax wooden floors that had already been waxed far too many times before, or cleaning with toothbrushes the metal grids on the edges of three flights of stairs. This kind of work was not punishment. It was simply the way we took good care of things. We did almost all of the work ourselves, and almost everything was in perfect condition most of the time. We never wasted anything. Wrapping paper and ribbons, boxes and jars, aluminum foil and plastic containers--all were saved to be used again and again. Our families would joke about our reusing everything and called it \\\\\"nunny.\\\\\" Nowadays many people do it but they call it ecology. We ordinarily awakened to a bell shortly after four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock and almost every minute of every day was sched-uled with some event or responsibility. We all retired at a specified time, usually no later than nine-thirty. 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 392 Permission was needed for exceptions. After the \\\\\"lights out\\\\\" time, some sisters read books in bed under the cov-ers with a flashligl~t. Our rooms were rather small (about 8 x 14 ft.), but they usually had everything we really needed. Back then what we really needed were a bed, a bedside table, a desk, a bookcase, a chair, a lamp, a closet, and a small dresser. Every room had a crucifix on the wall and a little bottle of holy water on the dresser. We did not hang other things on the walls, and we did not have nicknacks. In some of our convents, a few sisters lived in dormitories with curtains separating generally equal spaces which contained mostly the same furniture. In some convents the rooms might have a small sink and a small easy chair. We had common bathroom facilities, but often the superior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room had a private bath. Superiors also had a small, separate office, and the house treasurer usually did too. We could write to our family once a week. Family members could visit occasionally, oftener and more briefly if they lived nearby, less often and longer if they lived farther away. On these visits we never had meals together. We ate in the refectory with the sisters, and our families ate in the guest dining room. Any gifts our family brought were given immediately to the superior, who transferred the best of everything to the chaplain or the pastor if they were things a priest could use. We all regularly asked permission from the superior for doing such things as opening our mail, using the books at our disposal, and having necessary personal toi-let articles. About once a month the superior conducted a meeting of all the sisters which was known as \\\\\"chapter of faults.\\\\\" This had been a salutary monastic practice of publicly admitting to the sisters with whom you lived your own externally manifest foibles and failures and then asking forgiveness. But by the 1960s this practice Review for Religious had been truly trivialized into merely mentioning some fault from a previously prepared list of supposedly light or medium or serious ones. They ranged from leaving something out of place to talking during \\\\\"times of silence.\\\\\" Things we actually did or failed to do that really annoyed one another were mostly not on the list. It did not matter much what a sister mentioned from the list, because the sisters you lived with were already very much aware of your external foibles and failures. Some were even aware of your internal ones. What we actually did or failed to do that really annoyed each other was seldom on the list, - - but these provided the ever-present, unrelenting, mutual sandpaper of our lives together. Every sister knew it, all too well. Most sisters in local-community convents had sev-eral jobs besides teaching. Shortly after first profession I taught five classes of math a day (algebra, geometry, trigonometry) at a co-ed high school of a thousand stu-dents, was in charge of the bookstore (textbooks, sta-tionery supplies), was responsible for the convent cars (keeping them clean, full of gas, and fixed when neces-sary), was convent treasurer (\\\\\"qualified\\\\\" because I taught math), and traveled a hundred miles each Saturday for M.A. studies financed by a National Science Foundation grant. What I was doing was not unusual, it seems to me. But we were much younger then. When Vatican II began, the religious community I entered had 720 members. It owned and operated two colleges for women, three highly successful high schools, and a small hospital. All of these had a sister as presi- Most sisters in local-community convents had several jobs besides teaching. 64.4 200~ McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Coundl as Catalyst 3941 dent, principal, or CEO. All of these had at least a dozen sisters serving in various capacities. We also staffed sev-eral large Catholic high schools and more than three dozen Catholic grade schools in various dioceses in five different states. We were known for being quite good at what we did, and it seemed to me we were. We related professionally to the lay people with whom we worked, but we never really socialized with them. They were called \\\\\"seculars,\\\\\" and the sisters greatly outnumbered them. By the time I entered, because learning and teach-ing were central to our heritage, it was rare for a sister to be assigned to teach without having at least a B.A. degree. Many sisters already had or were studying for master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or doctoral degrees. Except for those studying, we all came \\\\\"home\\\\\" to the motherhouse and worked there or nearby during the summer months. In mid August year after year, we received any new assignments by hearing a list read aloud to all of us assembled in the motherhouse chapel. We were not consulted about the assignments. The very next day we were all on our way to this or that convent in this or that town, each of us with all our belongings. Back then, those belongings always fitted into one large trunk plus, for some, a small suitcase. The convent in which you landed in those days might be subject to the occasional but dreadfully harmful tyranny of a superior who probably should never have had a position of authority. In those days the mother general--the sister in charge of the whole congregation, who herself was elected--appointed all the local superi-ors. It was only in the mid 1970s that sisters in our local houses got to elect their own superior. The election of the mother general took place every four years at a for-mal, solemn gathering called the general chapter. All the sisters voted for delegates to the chapter, and the dele- Review for Religqous gates elected the mother general and the four councilors who assisted her. Besides the elections, these delegates also made decisions about other things that concerned the whole community. While the chapter was in progress, the rest of us usually did not know much about what was going on, although a few always seemed to know most of what was going on everywhere. In local communities, some superiors treated author-ity as a matter of control and more or less trampled on the sensibilities of others in the house, except for favorites of theirs (for whatever reason). In retrospect, it seems that the favorites were being groomed to become future superiors. Many of them did. The nonfavorites were thankful when they were assigned to another house or when the superior went \\\\\"out of office.\\\\\" Some incom-petent superiors, recycled in a sort of \\\\\"lateral arabesque,\\\\\" wreaked havoc again on sisters elsewhere. Such superi-ors were the exception, not the norm. But they were really notable exceptions if they were your own supe-rior. The convent in which you landed could also fall under the diplomatically gloved but predominantly iron hand of a local pastor who controlled everything, from the horarium (our daily schedule) to the purse strings. Back then, financial remuneration for sisters was a pittance. In the early 1970s I was among twenty-eight sisters in a city with one of the highest per capita incomes in the country. Two dozen of us had degrees, some even graduate degrees. We taught in a large diocesan high school or in a nearby parish grade school or worked in a diocesan office. One sister was a full-time cook for the convent. Though not many of us knew how to cook for twenty-eight people, we took turns helping to cook on weekends. Every sister in the convent received a salary of $1,800 per year. Of course, the convent and its mainte-nance were paid for by the parish or school, and we had 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 396 three cars for our use, paying only the cost of gas for community trips. At that time there was rarely any for-mal provision for sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 healthcare, but most necessary medical services were donated by local doctors and den-fists. No one ever even thought of retiring, so no retire-ment funds were ever requested or received. It all \\\\\"worked\\\\\" fiscally because there were so many of us and we were so young and lived so frugally. I cannot say we went without necessities and must admit we also had occasional extra amenities that were probably unavailable to most of our own families. Remarkably--or perhaps not so remarkably--we usually sent a monthly surplus to the motherhouse. In that way, convents which had difficulties in making ends meet could be given sup-plements from the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general fund. The gen-eral fund also supported our older sisters when they were no longer able to work, but every sister worked for as long as she could. In retrospect it seems that, if we had received higher stipends, we could have recycled much more of that town\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wealth into poorer schools and parishes elsewhere through our sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 donated services. Like most sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 communities, we also operated schools where many parents simply could not pay any tuition at all. Wherever you lived back then, ever-present poten-tial pitfalls of our life together centered on the possible overemphasis on externals or a possibly excessive legalism in observing regulations as supposedly indicative of what constituted a \\\\\"good sister.\\\\\" I label them potential pitfalls because, in retrospect, there may have been only three basic ways for us to deal constructively with the exter-nals and the legalism. These realities seemed to domi-nate the entire ethos of Catholicism in America before Vatican II, and they certainly fit all too comfortably into the total ambience of religious life. But, to be construc- Review for Religious tive about it, you could basically only comply with the externals or you could identify with them or you could try to internalize their meaning. Whether or not a sister was really prone to legalism was somehow related to which of the above options predominated for her. Back then, it seemed that just about any sister who wanted to stay in the convent could learn to comply with just about everything that was asked of her, and most did. Even if you did not like doing this or that, you could usually appear pretty good at doing it. Even novices could learn to comply externally most of the time, or at least enough of the time to be admitted to first profes-sion. At another level, back then it seemed to me that most sisters rather readily identified with the communal importance of what was expected of us for the sake of the bigger picture of who we were together. And most somehow sensed that who we were together was immensely greater than the sum of the parts. So the value of accepting certain externals of our collective identity, such as living and praying and working together or wear-ing the same habit or engaging in common practices, was eventually mostly integrated as part of the overall package that both strengthened and assuaged the ins and outs of the day-to-day reality of our lives. But, at still another level, back then it seemed to me that you could personally and spiritually internalize what-ever you did as fitting somehow in the adventure of hav-ing promised your whole life to God no matter what. It also seemed to me that some sisters, mostly older ones, had actually internalized what it might really mean to live our life within the ambience of all the externals but with a balance and healthiness that had no hint of legal-ism. They seemed to understand that none of the exter-nals were the essentials. They also seemed to understand 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst 398 that all we did was intended to foster somehow the life we publicly professed and interiorly hoped to live. I think we all truly hoped to be good, maybe even holy. And I think we all truly wanted to do good, no matter what we actually happened to do. From the deeper, longer, wiser perspective of these seasoned sisters, the externals seemed to matter less, even though they were faithful in observ-ing them. For sure, very early on, I knew I definitely wanted to belong someday to the last group just described. In the midst of all this, it also seemed to me that most of us were happy and productive most of the time. We mostly tried to be prayerful women as best we knew how and to be responsively obedient in sometimes diffi-cult circumstances. For the most part, we had fun with one another, good clean fun, much more often than onlookers may ever have suspected. For the most part, we were quite competent at what we did in significant areas of education, study, and learning. And the regimenta-tion of much of our life even afforded some sisters the opportunity of serving others much more effectively than they might have done on their own. Somehow, in com-munities of women religious forty years ago, in some real way, we really were family to one another, warts and all. And through it all, perhaps in spite of it all, we were definitely not all alike, and we knew it. We knew that no visible similarities rendered us actually similar. But we knew, too, that in many ways all was not well with the way we lived and that much could or should be effec-tively changed for the better. From the moment conciliar documents were avail-able in English, the sisters in my community enthusias-tically read and studied them. The promulgation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy in December 1963 had enormous positive consequences for American Review for Religious Catholic sisters. Until then, other than Mass, prayer in common for sisters in communities with post- Reformation origins often consisted entirely of medita-tion in common, various litanies~ multiple rosaries, and numerous devotional prayers composed by whoever had founded them. In these communities the meditation topic was usually chosen by the superior, announced the evening before, and had an obligatory format usually fol-lowing standard steps adapted from Ignatian spiritual-ity or from a variation of the 17th-century French school of spirituality. Sisters in communities tracing their her-itage to before the Reformation usually prayed a short-ened \\\\\"little office\\\\\" consisting of psalms, with antiphons and responses in honor of the Sacred Heart, the Blessed Virgin Mary, or others. These communities also prayed the rosary in common, but usually had fewer litanies and devotional prayers. Meditation was always in chapel together at an early hour, but a common meditation topic or specific method set by the superior would not usu-ally have been obligatory. Before the council, for the most part, only clergy were considered as officially praying the official Divine Office in the name of the church and as part of its offi-cial worship. Indeed, even if nonclergy prayed the same Divine Office from the same books, it was not considered participation in the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liturgical prayer. Very soon, however, sisters in communities of any heritage began chorally praying the psalms of the breviary and finding this practice to be immensely more meaningful than their previous devotions. The promulgation of the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation in November 1965 also proved particularly significant for American Catholic sisters, who responded instantly and enthusiastically to new or renewed biblical studies. But no conciliar document altered the reality of reli- 64.4 200Y McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Ca~alys~ gious life for sisters in apostolic congregations in the United States more than the Decree on the \\\\\"Accommodata Renovatione\\\\\" of Religious Life promulgated in October 1965. The Latin phrase accommodata renovatione is delib-erately retained here, not to be pedantic, but because this cryptic description of what was apparently intended for religious life is not easily translated and because one common translation--\\\\\"adaptation and renewal\\\\\"--is sim-ply not correct. This erroneous translation, however, was at first used so frequently that dichotomous expla-nations arose describing \\\\\"adaptation\\\\\" as pertaining to external elements of religious life and \\\\\"renewal\\\\\" as per-taining to internal, spiritual matters of religious life. The title actually called for the entire reality of religious life to be renewed or restored or refreshed or revived in a suitable or fitting manner. This was quite in keeping with John xxIII\\xe2\\x80\\x99S intention that the church more effec-tively bring the riches of salvation in Christ to bear on humanity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate and ultimate needs. To this end, article 2 of Perfectae caritatis made clear that effective renewal should occur under the influence of the Holy Spirit and with church guidance. It would involve returning to both the sources of Christian life and the initial inspiration of religious communities as adapted to the altered conditions of current times. PC (Perfectae caritatis, not personal computer!) affirmed fol-lowing Christ in the Gospels as the supreme rule of life for every religious, while urging acceptance and retention of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original spirit and aims and sound traditions. It encouraged religious institutes to foster church initiatives in keeping with their own proper char-acter. It mandated that communities should help their members to better understand human realities, world conditions, and the needs of the church. It strongly reaf-firmed the profession of the evangelical counsels and Review for Religious clearly emphasized the importance of spiritual renewal. Article 3 of PC asked every religious community to harmonize its life, prayer, and work with the physical and psychological condition of its members, and it asked us to do likewise in relation to the apostolate, the sur-rounding culture, and overall economic circumstances. It mandated examination of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mode of gov-ernment and called for proper revision of constitutions, directories, customs, prayers, and ceremonies in order to bring them into sync with changes promulgated in other conciliar documents. Article 4 of Perfectae caritatis urged the cooperation of all community members in the renewal effort, which it particularly entrusted to competent internal authorities such as general chapters and legitimate superiors. At the same time, it required superiors to consult with com-munity members and to actually listen to them. So it seemed to most of us that someone somewhere who had worked on the formulation of PC must have known that many things might need changing from the way they were back then. All this was prescribed in the context of our individ-ual response to a divine call to express our baptismal consecration more fully by living solely for God with an apostolic orientation in service of the church (articles 5 and 8). Not surprisingly, PC reaffirmed that the three evangelical counsels commonly professed by religious are spiritually and humanly efficacious for fostering maturity, responsible interaction with authority, and con-structive life together. The reordering of the traditional vow sequence from poverty-chastity-obedience to chastity-poverty-obedience was noted, though there was no evident reason for it (articles 12-15). PC also mandated alteration of religious habits inso-far as they were not conducive to hygiene or were no 401 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst Women religious in the Unl,ted States took these conciliar mandates)~,~- and challengers quite.seriously,\",\"responding to them with astounding interest and concerted action. 402 [ longer simple or were not genuinely attuned to apos-tolic needs (article 17). It initiated longer and more com-prehensive formation (article 18) and urged maintenance of current ministries while simultaneously calling for a renewed missionary spirit (article 20). And it pointedly reminded religious everywhere that the \\\\\"example of their own lives\\\\\" was the best invitation for others to join them in this way of witness in the church (article 23). Without a doubt, women religious in the United States took these conciliar mandates and challenges quite seriously, responding to them with astounding interest and concerted action. And, without a doubt, Vatican II was a catalyst for renewal. It initi-ated a genuine, whole-hearted, enthusiastic response on the part of American Catholic sis-ters regarding who they were, how they lived and prayed, what they did, and what they were being called to do. On the other hand, from the vantage point of hindsight, it is now rather clear that many changes in religious life catalyzed by the coun-cil did not proceed under the milder conditions that cat-alytic conversions are supposed to make possible. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, experimentation in living and praying and working seems never to have ended, while in some communities their living and praying and working seems never to have changed. In most communities of American Catholic sis-ters, constitutional revisions seem never to have found Review for Religious the last, best way of expressing what sisters really want to say, while in some communities only grammar and syn-tax seem to have been altered, and only minimally. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, corporate apostolates have almost completely disappeared, while in some communities apostolic endeavors seem to have remained exactly the same as they were forty years ago. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, many members wear completely secular attire, while in some communities the sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 only attire remains a Sunday or weekday or work habit, one of which is worn at all times. In most communities of American Catholic sisters, many members live alone in rented apartments, are responsible to no internal superior below the gen-eral council (now commonly known as a leadership team), find their own jobs, visit relatives at their own convenience, organize their own work schedules, and are basically responsible for maintaining their own well-being. In stark contrast, in some communities life is very much the same as it was forty years ago: all sisters live in convents, are assigned to ministry with little consulta-tion, have local superiors, follow a standard horarium, eat in common, wash dishes at table, never visit their families overnight, and--among a plethora of other per-sonal human constraints--may still be permitted to shower or bathe only once a week. This article refers to the council as a catalyst. In ret-rospect, it is clear that the catalytic impulse of the coun-cil occurred during a decade of rapid and sweeping cultural upheavals in the world. In retrospect, it is also clear that in the United States the catalytic impulse of Vatican lI coincided with conditions of extreme social turbulence. Ostensibly genuine responses to the man-dates of Vatican II during a time of great and ongoing social unrest seem to have resulted forty years later in a 64.4 2005 McDonough \\xc2\\xaf The Council as Catalyst far more than minimal divergence in the ways various communities of sisters in America live and pray and work. From what appear to be the result of forces in play forty years ago, in merely human terms the 1960s may have been the least auspicious time for the church to have sug-gested that American Catholic sisters should reassess every aspect of their lives. Indeed, it seems that strongly affirmed good inten-tions and long-sustained earnest efforts have actually brought American Catholic sisters to diametrically opposed positions of immense disparity in spirituality, theology, apostolic endeavors, internal structures, and overall functioning. In four decades of trying to achieve an accommodata renovatio, many communities of American Catholic sisters appear to have unconsciously but enthu-siastically adapted themselves into impending oblivion, while some other communities of American Catholic sis-ters appear to have consciously and steadfastly remained basically unrenewed. And, in this ongoing process, the genuine challenge of Vatican Council II for religious life as a gift to the church--and to the waiting world-- remains as yet overwhelmingly unrealized. Or so it seems to me. His Smile Radiant goodness broke out from ear to ear a would-be down of pain turned up a smile ingratiating, inviting a welcome sign to an open heart\",\"a home. I stepped in and stayed awhile. Walter Bunofsky SVD Review for Religious CHRISTIAN RAAB Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney Toe 1993 Harold Ramis film Groundhog Day is the ry of a television weatherman named Phil, played by Bill Murray, who soon finds himself in a time warp. As the film begins, Phil is cocky, sarcastic, and self-important and resents being sent to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the Groundhog Day festival. He spends the day ridiculing the provin-cialisms of the people, bragging about his chances of becoming an anchorman, and trying, rather rudely, to charm his attractive ~producer, Rita, played by Andie MacDowell. At day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TV crew gets snowed in. Phil awakens the next day to discover that it is February 2 once again, though he is the only one who seems to notice. He relives the whole day, encounter by encounter, no more gracefully and with even more frustration than he had the day before. He finally goes to bed, hoping that he has gotten over the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worst case of d4j~ vu. He awakens, however, to find that it is February 2 for Christian Raab OSB is a newly professed Benedictine monk at St. Meinrad Archabbey\",\"100 Hill Drive\",\"St. Meinrad, Indiana 47577. 64.4 200Y Raab \\xc2\\xaf Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney the third time. These repetitions continue for the rest of the movie. Phil quite clearly has become stuck in Groundhog Day. As he keeps reliving this day and reencountering the people in it, Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reactions change--from utter frus-tration and angry outbursts to something else. He real-izes that a life without consequences beyond one day can be used for unbounded pleasure seeking. When he tires of this, he turns his attention toward winning the heart of Rita. He spends days figuring out who the perfect man is in Rita\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, and then he pretends to be this person. Needless to say, it does not work. Phil responds with despair and, believing it is the only way out of his private hell, tries again and again to end his life. After each attempt, however, he awakens to the same song on the radio and sees that it is still February 2. Finally Phil recognizes that his selfishness is getting him nowhere. He begins to live for others. He gets to know people and responds to their needs. He feeds a homeless man. He is kind to an annoying character. He helps counsel a young couple. He knows what time every day several old ladies get a flat tire and hurries there to fix it for them. He knows what time each day a young boy falls from a tree, and he rushes there to catch him. Discovering that he has a gift for music, he develops and shares it. He becomes part of the community he once ridiculed, and at last, by forgetting himself, he escapes his fate and reaches February 3. There is something about Phil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Groundhog Day that living as a novice in a Benedictine monastery resonates with. Benedictine iife, especially in the novitiate, is very structured and repetitive. Every day begins the same. At 5:15 a.m., the bells announce Morning Prayer. After Morning Prayer is breakfast, then private spiritual read-ing. At 7:30 a.m. we return to church for Mass. When Review for Religious this is over, we may grab a quick cup of coffee before the workday begins at 8:30 a.m. Coffee break is at 10 a.m. At noon comes Midday Prayer and then lunch, fol-lowed by work or class again at 1 p.m. At 4:30 p.m. the workday ends. The monks go back to church at 5 p.m. for Vespers. After this we have another period of private spiritual reading, and then at 6 p.m. we meet for the evening meal. After dinner, monks are usually free to recreate, study, or go to bed, as the case may be. The monk ends his day, goes to sleep, awakens again the next day to the ring-ing of the bells, and the cycle begins again. It is - - a structured, repetitive, and somewhat predictable life. In some ways, every day feels the same. Of course, this structured life is not just a repetition of practices. More important, it is a repetition of encoun-ters with people. It is easy to know that a particular brother can be expected to sit at a particular place in the refectory during breakfast. A certain father will be arriv-ing at the coffeemaker at 7 a.m. Some monks will sit on this side of the calefactory during coffee, break, and oth-ers will sit on the other side. We expect to see certain monks in the computer lab before we open the door. We know who will almost surely be playing cards after supper. We become familiar with the sounds of monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 breathing and walking. We begin to know who will like a book and who will hate it, who will take a joke and who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, who likes hugs and who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, who prefers the mornings and who prefers the evenings. In the way that monastic life provides a series of repeat encounters This structured life is not just a repetition of practices\",\"it is a repetition of encounters with people. 407 64.4 2005 Raab \\xc2\\xaf Monks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Stability and Punxsutawney 408 and practices, it is not much different from Groundhog Day. The monk, unlike Phil, voluntarily chooses this life of repetitive practices and encounters in connection with the vow of stability. The vow is a monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise to stay in the same place with the same people and engage in the same monastic practices for the rest of his life. Like all the vows, stability is a means toward the end of con-version. Our Brother John Mark explains that stability aids conversion by providing a sure and solid context in which the human will may conform to the will of the loving God. He compares the human will to a steel rod that, in conversion, is bent into conformity with the divine will. One cannot bend a rod without having something strong and solid to hold it in place. This is what stabil-ity does. It provides the strong and solid foundation that makes conversion--the bending of the rod--possible. Stability means the monk stays put. He commits to repeat his day over and over again in the same place with the same people doing the same things. And so the monk, in a very real way, is choosing to do what Phil did invol-untarily, to stay in one place, to relive and reencounter while being transformed. Repetition can help us with this transformation, not merely by keeping us surefooted, but by supplying and resupplying opportunities for loving choices. For exam-ple, because I am in this repetitive life, each day I have the opportunity to be more attentive in liturgy, and to be more open in prayer, than I was earlier. As I live and work each day alongside some people who annoy me, I have the opportunity to \\\\\"love my enemies,\\\\\" to set aside grievances, to practice patience, to exercise charity. Each day I have the opportunity to anticipate needs in the elderly monks, to clean things with more care than I did Review for Religious the day before, to listen with more receptivity to the lonely and the needy. Because so many of our experiences and encounters repeat themselves, I am, each day and always, given the opportunity to be humble where I was proud, to be chaste where I was lustful, to be calm where I was angry, to be forgiving where I was unforgiving, to be assertive where I was a pushover. In this way, stability, by its rep-etition, can be accepted as a great gift on the path to holiness. The monk who perseveres can, like Phil, be trans-formed. Like Phil, we may come to this life with prob-lems of self-centeredness, sarcasm, conceit, anger, despair, or lust. But, if we are open to the grace that comes with living, out stability in a monastic community, we, like Phil, may be transformed into persons of char-ity. In the last scene of Groundhog Day, Phil has finally \\\\\"gotten it right\\\\\" and the morrow has finally come. On the morning of February 3, the now-transformed Phil says to Rita with joyful single-mindedness, \\\\\"Is there any-thing I can do for you today?\\\\\" It is this monk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope that he may be able to start his own day, each day, with the same happy singularity of purpose, saying to my broth-ers and to God, \\\\\"Is there anything I can do for you today?\\\\\" ZPlease:note that the phone and fax number for the editorial offices of Review for Religious :have changed.

He forged his ideas 6n the hard anvil of his own conversion and his need, as a bishop, to defend the teaching of the Catholic Church. This combination of speculation and experience gives his writings a unique ongoing relevance. Their blending of the theoretical and the practical is nowhere more evident than in his teaching on the Holy Spirit. His Spirit doc-trine develops through three movements: his agonizing effort leading to his conversion, his need as a pastor to explain the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doc-trines, and his awareness that the action of grace is the love of the Holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts.

As I come to write these reflections in our final issue of the year 2009, I share various reac-tions that have been part of the landscape over the past months. My first response to the doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prognosis ff)r pancreatic cancer was that it is a gift to be told that one has so many months to live and that an end is in sight. The doctor, of course, went on to give options. I could have an operation, and it would likely add some months. I could also have the operation, followed by chemotherapy/radia-tion, and it would add some months and likely some years. The doctor wanted to give me some time to think about the options, but I immedi-ately agreed with his own stated preference that I would undergo the operation and follow up chemotherapy. It seemed that medically I was in a place where I should follow the biblical injunc-tion, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"choose life.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The operation seemed to be successful in removing the visible cancer, and the six-month- long chemotherapy treatment has been an experimental study program including a vaccine that eliminates radiation. I have fin-ished the program as of the publication of this issue. Now I live within a wait-and-see time of measurement and ~esting. Revie~v for Religious November remains a church time to remember the dead and remind ourselves of our own mortality. I have been feeling even more attuned to the reality of my own personal dying throughout these past months so that it is easy to celebrate November liturgy. It is nice to be put \\\\\\\\\\\\\"on notice\\\\\\\\\\\\\"--which is how I consider the identi-fication of my cancer. The likelihood of dying is just made more real and, as it were, within reach. It allows me time to reflect and pray how I face this kind of time, what attitude I want to take, and how I want to use the time I have. It does not seem fearsome or dark. In fact, it seems full of surprises of how God wants to meet me in unexpected ways, sometimes not initially pleasing to me. I seem to be taught a lot about powerlessness, patience, and the goodness of strangers. I also believe strongly in the efficaciousness of the prayer support of others. Advent is a church time of looking forward to new life and especially of our life forever with God. It con-eludes with Christmas, a celebration of how God, in Christ, enters into our human life, never to let it go. Throughout 2009 with all its medical focus, I have con-tinued to be blessed with finding new life and I again look forward to entering into Advent with greater \\xc2\\xaf appreciation. Christmas will be God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own gift to me of celebrating the gift of human life for however many more months and years God intends. With celebrating Christmas, it is good to remember that we were all born to be living a life forever with God, and that remains my hope too. David L. Fleming SJ 341 The Review for Religious Advisory Board and Editorial Staff wish all of our readers a most blessed Advent and Christmas season. 68.4 2009 RANDALL S. ROSENBERG Christian Existence and Theology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance theology and life 342 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ihe Swiss thinker Hans Urs yon Balthasar is something of an enigma. He has been called the greatest Catholic theologian of the 20th century. He is the inspiration behind many believers who understand themselves as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"orthodox\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"solid\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Catholics. His work has been seen as an example of greater integration of spirituality and theology. He is the author to whom Jon Sobrino SJ refers in his reflec-tions on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"faith of Christ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a controver-sial position which has been criticized by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. His ideas about gender complementarity and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordination have angered many.

Wydown Boulevard\\\\\", \\\\\"St. Louis, Missouri 63105. Review for Religious beginning to make use of his thought to meet the con-cerns of liberation and political theology. My plan here is not to analyze all these currents. Rather, I intend to look at Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinctive ideas about the aesthetic-dramatic constitution of Christian reality. He sees God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-disclosure, as occurring first in aesthetic and dramatic forms, and he sees Christians as called to be co-actors in this \\\\\\\\\\\\\"theo-drama\\\\\\\\\\\\\" through liturgical ritual and a distinctive way of living. A Generational Concern Some of my attraction to Balthasar is probably gen-erational. I was born ten years after the Second Vatican Council. Although my childhood was shaped by a won-derful Catholic parish and school, my contemporaries and I still experienced what William Portier has called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the dissolution of the American Catholic subcul-ture.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Not that I particularly desire a restoration of the good old days\\\\\", \\\\\"for many, those days were apparently not so good. But it seemed to me, as I began to read Balthasar, that he was not only restoring something of the Christian vision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rich particularity and oddness, but also pointing out to people how beautifully and dra-matically that vision has enhanced all kinds of human lives, the great variety of saints most eminently. As he writes in Love Alone Is Credible, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lovers are the ones who know most about God\\\\\", \\\\\"the theologian must listen to them\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (p. 12). It was exciting to discover a thinker who brought into his theology the witness of holy people and great texts not normally found in systematic theologians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reflection: Th~r~se of Lisieux, John.of the Cross, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Dante, to name just a few. 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Cbristian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance Balthasar preserved what he called a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"kneeling theology,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" without downplaying the use of reason in Christian life. And yet this same thinker also engaged seriously the thought of Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. In other words--Rodney Howsare has shown this in his book Baltbasar and Protestantism: The Ecumenical Implications of His Theological Style--Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theological vision had room both for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation in Christ and for the works of reli-gious- philosophical scholars as legitimate moments in under-standing and present-ing Christian truth. Balthasar preserved what he called a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"kneeling theology,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" without downplaying the use of reason in Christian life. His enviable dis-play of both loving devotion and a critical engagement with modernity prompts me to see him as embodying in important ways the dual task of ressourcement and aggior-namento set by Vatican II. Christian Existence as Theo-Drama The aesthetic-dramatic nature of Christian life is shown in the Scriptures. Moses and Paul experienced, aesthetically, the beauty or glory of God in the burn-ing bush and on the road to Damascus. These aesthetic encounters were also dramatic, and they led to the rest of their lives\\xe2\\x80\\x99 being high drama as well. It is a com-mon feature of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures that experiences of God are not just holy feelings\\\\\", \\\\\"they have a vocational, missionary purpose. The first part of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s multivolume trilogy, The Glory of the Lord, describes the way we first encounter the phenomenon Review for Religious of divine revelation as beautiful. The second part of the trilogy, Theo-Drama, recognizes that God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation is not something we merely look at\\\\\", \\\\\"rather, we are drawn into the drama of revelation and are called to respond. Robert Barron nicely captures Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dra-matic emphasis: Christianity--like painting, baseball, and philoso-phy- is a world, a form of life. And, like those other worlds, it is first approached because it is perceived as beautiful. A youngster walks onto a baseball dia-mond because he finds the game splendid, and a young artist begins to draw because she finds the artistic universe enchanting. Once the beauty of Christianity has seized a devotee, she will long to submit herself to it, entering into its rhythms, its institutions, its history, its drama, its visions and activities. And then, having practiced it, having worked it into her soul and flesh, she will know it. The movement, in short, is from the beautiful (it is splendid!) to the good (I must play it!) to the true (it is right). In my own encounter with Balthasar, I have most appreciated his dramatic emphasis. In the first volume of his breathtaking five-volume Theo-Drama, Balthasar gives attention to the drama of human existence by using writers like Shakespeare, George Bernanos, Bertolt Brecht, Eugene Ionesco, and even the American Arthur Miller in a kind of prolegomenon to his understanding of Christian existence as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"theodramatic.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" His range of reference to Christian, non-Christian, and even anti- Christian dramatists is astonishing. He uses the theater to illuminate the risk and gravity of human life, the catastrophes and tensions that constitute our existence, and the finite time span within which we must struggle for the good, under judgment and in the face of death. The theater can offer an opening to people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encoun- 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Theology\\xe2\\x80\\x99$ Relevance 346 ter with revelation. Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theodramatic approach employs the metaphor of the world stage. As actors in history, human beings share in the Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mission, under the Holy Spirit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction. Just as an actor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in a theatrical drama constitutes a limited part of the play for a particular purpose, the finite lives of persons who share in the mission of Christ, no matter their life span, dis-close meaning that is relevant for the whole of history. On a personal note, I have appreciated Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dramatic treatment of the tragic in human existence. I have made my own the following remark of Rowan Williams: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"What I found in Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work was an extraordinary depth of contemplative understand-ing, along with vivid awareness of the tragic quality of human existence--the hellishness of humanity and God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in it--which resonated very deeply with me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Ever since I was a child, I have been par-ticularly sensitive to this tragic dimension, a disposition that has been heightened by my wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily work with children who suffer from cancer. The problem of evil as it manifests itself in sickness, natural disasters, random acts of violence, war, oppression, and genocide is never far from my mind. The late British theologian Donald MacKinnon, noting that Balthasar rarely treats the horror of the Holocaust directly, adds that \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the nervous ten~ion of the whole argument witnesses to the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion-ate concern to present the engagement of God with his world in a way that refuses to turn aside from the over-whelming, pervasive reality of evil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Balthasar does not paper over the pathos of the real world, a pathos full of darkness and ambiguity. For him, God, in the incarna-tion and passion of Jesus, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"steps to his opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side and, from within, helps him reach justice and freedom. Review for Religious Hnitude, time, and death are not negated: they are given a new value in a way that is beyond our comprehension. Indeed, even what is hostile to God, in all its profound abysses, is not abandoned\\\\\", \\\\\"God does not turn his back on it: it is taken over and reworked.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Balthasar never taught academic theology at a uni-versity. He spent many years, however, as a university chaplain. In the Switzerland of the 1940s this kind of work was largely cultural. Balthasar the chaplain spent his time giving lectures, in the evening debating in various student societies, and giving retreats. To borrow John W. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Malley SJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s useful catego-ries from his Four Cultures of the West, Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought more resembles cultures three and four--\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Poetry, Rhetoric, and the Common Good\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Art and Performance\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-- than it does culture two--\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Academy and the Professions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Malley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks on Erasmus could be said about Balthasar: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"He felt he could criticize Scholastic theology because he had an alternative to offer: a return to the more literary and rhetorical style of the Fathers. That was the \\xe2\\x80\\x99ancient and genuine\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the-ology, quite different from the \\xe2\\x80\\x99modern\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theology. It was genuine because it was drawn directly from the sacred texts and because it had led to a \\xe2\\x80\\x99theological life.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It touched the heart and centered on the few truths that were essential to Christianity rather than on the second-ary issues the Scholastics pursued\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (p. 160). Balthasar once remarked that his study with the Jesuits, largely in Neo-Scholastic mode, was a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"grim struggle with what men had made out of the glory of revelation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He Balthasar never taught academic theology ,at a university. 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance 348 ~ \\\\\\\\\\\\\"could not endure this presentation of the Word of God and wanted to lash out with the fury of Samson,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tear \\\\\\\\\\\\\"down the whole temple,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and bury himself \\\\\\\\\\\\\"beneath the rubble.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is often true that Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mode of presentation resembles a patristic sermon more than a scholastic treatise. In my recent experiences of presenting papers, giv-ing academic lectures, and doing job interviews, it has become evident that this aesthetic-dramatic emphasis genuinely excites scholars and ordinary laypeople. This emphasis could also be said to be Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest shortcoming as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"systematic\\\\\\\\\\\\\" theologian. He is called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"unsystematic\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by those who argue for the indispens-ability of a more scientifically or theoretically con-structed theology in the manner of Thomas Aquinas. Let me address both sentiments. On the one hand, I am convinced that Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dramatic emphasis nurtures an appreciation for the inexhaustible mystery that resides at the heart of Christian revelation. He offers a richly symbolic and imaginative approach--one that fosters better Christian living, namely, the dramatic artistry needed for fulfill-ing our own unique missions. That is, his theology can give momentum to the religious feelings and beliefs that help us accomplish good in the particular circumstances of our lives. On the other hand, the aesthetic-dramatic emphasis is not always helpful when one does \\\\\\\\\\\\\"system-atic theology\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in order to answer the further questions that arise out of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dramatic, liturgical, or devotional life. Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology, besides being eclectic, has a contemplative emphasis that prefers to let \\\\\\\\\\\\\"paradox\\\\\\\\\\\\\" be the answer, rather than carefully working out a set of terms and relations and bringing a theo-logical intelligibility to the concrete conditions in which Review for Religious Christians live their lives. One is more likely to find this kind of intelligibility in Bernard Lonergan or Karl Rahner. Let me offer an example. It was my encounter with the writings of Balthasar that helped me discover the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"weightiness\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the mystery of the cross. Balthasar is not content with presenting the cross as merely a consequence of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prophetic stance in the world. It is that, but it is also much more. It contains a vicarious element, which somehow involves Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"taking on\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the sin of the human race. Balthasar desires to do justice to a dominant theme in the Fathers, namely, the admirabile commercium, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\\\\\\\\\"wondrous exchange,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with sinners. With aesthetic and dramatic power, Balthasar communi-cated to me the cross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power and centrality. And yet as questions arose--How did Jesus \\\\\\\\\\\\\"take on\\\\\\\\\\\\\" sin? Did he also take on our guilt? If so, did he also experience a loss of hope and the kind of darkness sinners experience?-- I became less satisfied with his systematic answers (or lack thereof). In my own research I have been more satisfied with a Thomist pattern of explanation (also not without its critics), given contemporary expression in Bernard Lonergan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writings on \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Satisfaction\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Law of the Cross.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Such writings offer terms and relations that can be used in engaging the modern sciences construc-tively. Balthasar has often prompted in me an excite-ment and concern about such theological questions Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology, has a contemplative emphasis that prefers to let \\xe2\\x80\\x99,paradox\\\\\\\\\\\\\" be the answer. 349 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance and then failed to give me adequate answers. In his De Verbo Incarnato, Lonergan writes that, if one approaches Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death with primarily a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"symbolic mentality,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" where image and feeling predominate, then one is likely to express the meaning of the cross in terms of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"substitution\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"satispassion,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that is, in terms of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"suffering enough\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for sins. These words do not do justice to the sophistication of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach, but they indicate something about his theological style in general and his theology of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death in particular. In my estimation, because of its dramatic terminology and its reliance on the mystical experiences of Adrienne von Speyr, Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death is often unclear and even reckless. I wonder, though, whether this theological question, sparked by the power of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation, would have occurred to me at all without his help. Balthasar himself was not concerned with meeting the requirements of a technical, theoretical, systematic theologian. He once said in an interview, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"My books are not the kind of theology that belongs to the aca-demic guild and therefore they are not particularly suited for dissertations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He remarked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have to say that for me the only truly interesting theologians are the saints: from. Irenaeus through Augustine to Anselm, to Bonaventure, or figures that allow the radiation of holiness to show forth, such as Dante or Newman\\\\\", \\\\\"one could also mention Kierkegaard and Solovyov.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" A Call for Fruitful Integration My concern goes beyond the question of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adequacy as a systematic theologian. I have accentuated his aesthetic-dramatic approach here, but I know there are many other approaches as well. My concern is the Review for Religious shape of Catholic theology in the 21st century and the place of the aesthetic-dramatic style therein. Vv\\xe2\\x80\\x99hat does theology conceived in Anselmian fashion as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"faith seek-ing understanding\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mean in light of the many theologi-cal styles we have inherited from the 20th century, from what Fergus Kerr has called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the Heroic Generation\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? In my discussion of the cross, I have offered a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the-oretical\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"explanatory\\\\\\\\\\\\\" challenge to Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theological style. Let me now say that Balthasar, too, offers a challenge. He makes us ask: Must not theol-ogy go well :beyond understanding to an understand-ing that is aesthetically and dramatically in touch with the joys and challenges of ordinary Christian existence? Shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t theology be more attentive to the Mystery that is encountered in aesthetic and dramatic form in our workaday world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer and worship? A question remains regarding what to do with the diversity of theological styles we have inherited. R.R. Reno has suggested that \\\\\\\\\\\\\"we need a period of consolidation that allows us to integrate the lasting achievements of the Heroic Generation into a renewed standard theology.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Let me suggest, without adequate exposition, one possible way forward, a way which has been similarly outlined by Robert Doran SJ. The chal-lenge of this generation is to integrate three 20th-cen-tury theological movements--contemporary Thomism, the ressourcement project of la nouvelle thdologie, and the various expressions of political-liberation theol-ogy. These three movements could be of help (1) in explaining theological doctrines in a theoretical man-ner that is capable of engaging with the natural and social sciences in search of a unity of knowledge\\\\\", \\\\\"(2) in experiencing and mediating Catholic thought and culture through aesthetic-dramatic forms\\\\\", \\\\\"and (3) in 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance dealing with concrete human suffering of all kinds in light of the gospel mandate to transform a world in need. Such a grand vision would require sympathetic and critical conversations, the highlighting of comple-mentarities and dialectical differences, and the humil-ity to be open to revision. If such an integration were to occur, it would require doing justice in an orderly way to the richness of being human in the flow of his-tory, that is, being psychological, intellectuall rational, moral, loving, mystical, and worshipful. For this enter-prise Balthasar would certainly not have all the answers, but he would have much to contribute to it.

Perception of such impalpable reality may take no time or consume no little time. Communicating that reality, however, normally requires time, and maybe a detour. Anyway, in the present case, the process has been for me an experience of obscurum per obscurius, though at the end it was all darum (clear), bathed in light. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hindu Prayer: A First for Congress\\\\\\\\\\\\\"--that was the title of the news item from India Abroad News Service on 14 September 2000. The news was the historic event of a Hindu priest delivering the opening prayer in the United States House of Representatives.1 The prayer ran as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"O God, you are omnipresent, omnipo-tent, and omniscient. You are everything, and nothing A. Paul Dominic SJ wrote for us about dreams in 2008. His address is Aishalton c/o St Ignatius Mission\\\\\", \\\\\"Lethem P.O.\\\\\", \\\\\"Rupununi, Guyana (South America).

You are our teacher, and you guide us on to righteousness .... Today, in this great hall, are assembled the elected representatives of the people of this nation. They are ready to perform their duties. God, please guide them in their thoughts and actions so they can achieve\\xe2\\x80\\x99the greatest good for all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The prayer ended with an invocation from the ancient scriptures of India. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"May all be happy, may all be free from disease, may all realize what is good, may none be subject to misery\\\\\", \\\\\"peace, peace, peace be unto all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fact of the Hindu prayer in the U.S. Congress was objectionable and even threatening to some. Many others strongly counterprotested. Anyway, the words of the prayer cannot be construed really offensive to any-one, except of course an atheist. As a matter of fact, they breathe the deepest longings of harried humanity hop-ing in the Divinity. The way they are addressed to God smacks of no narrow Hinduism nor any sectarianism for that matter, but an inclusive theism. The God invoked is everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s God.2 If the Hindu priest had his own traditional or peculiar thoughts about God, in no way does that show itself in his prayer. Even the concluding prayer, taken from the Hindu scriptures, sounds indeed more universal than particularly Hindu. It seems to show that genuine prayer cuts across ,barriers of religion. Everything connected with prayer in Hinduism can-not, of course, be explained thus. There are aspects of Hindu worship that are confined and meaningful only to adherents of Hinduism with its practices and tenets. Even here, however, it is wise to distinguish between what is exclusively Hindu and what is purely religious-- Review for Religious even though in practice the two are generally too inter-twined to detect. We should, however, exercise ourselves in this regard, for we can be surprisingly enriched as Christians and, what is more, find ourselves agree-ably bonded with other sincere believers. For example, though the ritual of sacrifice in various religions is dif-ferent in all of them and likely to distract and distance other people, the faith element in those sacrifices can be heartwarming and edifying to all those who can intuit it. Some reading I did about Hindu sacrifice proved to be quite inspiring. From it I got a sense of the homely and heavenly meaning of sacrifice beyond the altar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s formal vesture, furnishings, and ceremony. I have grown to believe that eating at table has the character and odor of a true sacrifice. I was confirmed in my belief when I found a simi-lar thought in a poet with a Christian background. He shares his vision charmingly and persuasively: Since you must kill to eat, and rob the newly born of its mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship, And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacri-ficed for that which is purer and still more innocent in man.3 I have no inkling of how the poet arrived at his vision of profound truth. I can recount, however, my experience in this regard, recalling first the Hindu insight. i have grown to believe that eating at table has the character and odor of a true sacrifice. 68.4 2009 Dominic * How You Eat Matters A Hindu Adumbration The universe in the ancient Hindu vision originat-ing from the Vedic4 times of 2000 BC consisted of three worlds: the physical, the psychological, and the spiritual manitCesting themselves not as separate but congruent spheres. Fire (Affni in Sanskrit) at the physical level was obviously visible flames, like those burning a sacrificial offering to the deity. At the psychological level it was the mind exercising itself in thinking and knowing. At the spiritual level the same word was a name of God. Given the superiority of the spiritual over the physical and the psychological, the latter two were regarded and grasped as manifestations of the one supreme Spirit called Agrni, extending through the three-tiered universe. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The fire which is the sun, the fire which is the earth, that fire is in my own heart,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a Vedic verse put it pithily. One cannot miss the images of the three worlds: the sun standing for the spiritual, the earth for the material, and the human for the psychological.5 Anyone who is not at ease with this ancient under-standing needs only a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought to see its con-nection with reality. For this a comparison with another religious tradition may help. In the Judaic tradition, physical fire serves the cultic needs of purification and liturgical rituals of offering. Fire that necessarily burns can signi~ blazing anger and, more importantly, the tribulation that cleanses the heart and proves the soul righteous. Fire is predicated of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own self in theophanies of saving presence, transcendence, and benevolence. God appears as the burning bush and the pillar of fire and indeed as consuming fire (Dt 4:24, 9:3\\\\\", \\\\\"Is 33:14). God purifies his servants and sets them afire with zeal so that the whole universe may shine in glory. Christian tradition has inherited this entire view Review for Religious and given it its own emphasis. Recall Jesus saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have come to bring fire on the earth and desire that it be kindled\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Lk 12:49).6 Observing parallels in the Vedic and Biblical views of the world, one may see other ones as well. In the Vedic thought, sacrifice involves a conscious perception that the three worlds are bound together as one universe. Sacrifice involves lighting a fire and burning an obla-tion on the altar. The idea behind the ritual is that the spiritual fire that is in heaven is also buried in the earth, and so it bursts forth when stones or sticks are struck. By being burned, the gifts laid on the altar are carried to heaven. The fiery sacrifice returns all that is on the earth to its original source in heaven. The ideal of sacrifice behind this graphic picture is not absent in the Bible. Elijah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successful sacrifice when the prophets of Baal miserably failed (1 K 18:22.-38) comes to mind here. To continue still further with the inner significance of the Vedic sacrifice, as long as sacrifice is performed everything keeps returning to its origin, and human beings find themselves living in harmony with the uni-verse. When people fail in their duty of sacrifice, they interfere with the cyclic rhythm that sustains the world of which they are a part. They use the mountain of gifts without attending to their nature, thereby isolating both themselves and all things from their origin. They violate the law of the universe. But, when sacrifice is duly and gratefully done, it redounds to universal prosperity. This seems reflected in Psalm 50: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and pay your vows to the Most High.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The last element of all sacrifice is perhaps too obvi-ous to be striking: it is eating the sacrificial offerings. What is offered in sacrifice is normally things that peo-ple eat, and so a sacrifice ends as a sacrificial meal. But 68.4 2009 Dominic \\xc2\\xaf How You Eat Matters In the matter of sacrifice, the universal beliefwas that, when humans ate something of the sacrifice, the deity had partaken of it first. who eats in sacrifice? Those who sacrifice, of course. But, as the sacrifice is not offered to themselves, they do not eat alone. When the sacrifice is consumed by fire, it is believed that the deity above consumes it. This understanding is highlighted in the Hindu scriptural verse: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I, the Lord, become the fire of life, and seated in the body I consume the four kinds of food.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This passage is certainly obscure for many, though it is for Hindus a familiar verse (vakya in Sanskrit) of the Bhagavad Gita, perhaps the most personal of all their scriptures. Anyway, what it says links human eating with divine eat-ing. In the matter of sacrifice, the universal belief was that, when humans ate something of the sacrifice, the deity had partaken of it first. Similarly, one may well conclude that what humans eat in ordinary meals is at the same rime consumed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the fire of life,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which is none other than God dwelling in human bodies. And so a human meal itself becomes a sacrifice to God. Bede Griffiths, the English Benedictine who, along with other foreign pioneers in India, continued the Indian tradition of ashram (akin to monasticism in the Western tradition), explains the point thus: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"That fire, which is in the heaven above and in the earth beneath, is in our own bodies\\\\\", \\\\\"we offer our food in sacrifice in that inner fire and it is consumed in the fire and surrendered to God again. So a meal is a sacrifice.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Here is a subtle move from a sacrificial meal eaten on occasion to daily Review for Religious meals eaten in the joyous, harmonious spirit of sacri-fice. Drawing from another stanza in the Bhagavad Gita, Griffiths concludes that \\\\\\\\\\\\\"anyone taking a meal without sacrificing is a thief\\\\\", \\\\\"this is to take the gifts of God and appropriate them to oneself instead of receiving them as gifts and returning thanks.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x997 A Christian Follow-Up Such a thought can startle nominal or profane Christians who have no thought of God whatever when they satisfy their hunger and thirst or overly indulge their tastes. Normal devout Christians accustomed to their routine mealtime prayer may well find more mean-ing in their daily practice. The grace before and after meals will then become the grace of meals as sacrifice. The whole meal from start to finish becomes an exercise and experience of grace, with the grace understood in terms of sacrifice. If sacrifice involves material fire for burning the oblation, daily meals as sacrifice ought to burn with the psychospiritual fire of desire--desire not merely for food, but for the One who gives the food. The Giver of food gives not only the natural and won-derful food and drink, but also the hunger, thirst, and taste buds necessary to enjoy it. Further, through our gratefulness God raises our minds beyond the mean philosophy of eat, drink, and be merry before it is too late. Enkindled by this grate-fulness, we cannot but experience a burning hunger for God. This does not produce asceticism in us so much as refine our taste for the simple, healthy, necessary food that makes for joyous living. At the same time it enables us to find God in food itself.8 This way of eating, that is much more than munching and gulping, becomes a sacrifice by virtue of the prayer surrounding our meals. 68.4 2009 Dominic \\xc2\\xaf How You Eat Matters As St. Paul says, food is for the stomach and the stom-ach for food, and ultimately the body is for the Lord (1 Co 6:13). Sacrificial prayer, then, from hearts burn-ing with fervor for God, rises like incense and raises people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirits while leaving them contented with their daily bread. It is the very opposite of making a god of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s belly (Ph 3:19)9 and sacrificing to it. This talk is not farfetched or feverishly imagined. It breathes the spirit of Jesus who, being more a mystic than an ascetic, ate with much gratitude to his Abba God and with the childlike merriment of having been blessed. When necessary he gave hungry people food, but he also chided them for not understanding their hunger aright. One may learn a lot from his controversy with them as they were looking for him the day after he had miraculously fed them with bread and fish to their hearts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 content (Jn 6). He unveiled to them their own undignified thoughts regarding food and satisfaction. He warned them not to work for food that cannot give life, but for the food from God that gives eternal life. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bread comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jesus told them that people do not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth (Mr 4:4). Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conduct in eating teaches about meal as sac-rifice. He takes the bread, looks up to heaven where his Abba Father dwells, gives thanks to him, and shares the bread with those around him generously, then pre-sumably eats along with them till finally making sure that nothing that remains goes to waste (Mt 14:19-20). While this pictures partly the proper Jewish uttering of a blessing such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Praised be thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from earth,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jesus portrays more faithfully and characteristi- Review for Religious cally what his Abba intended when he led his people, feeding them with manna and so training them for life. His counsel to his eager listeners on the Mount is not to worry about food and drink. His words are meant to uplift them with the realization of their blessings on any given day, making of it a sacrifice of praise and grati-tude. The same spirit suffuses the prayer Jesus taught people to pray: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Lk 11:2-3). Because our daily meals are ideally sacrifices filling us with gratitude and.uniting us with the bountiful Abba Father, Jesus began his unique sacrifice at an ordinary, if festive, meal, his last meal before he died. And there he bequeathed his new sacrifice in the form of a unique meal. It is with the same inspiration that he spoke of the heavenly life with God as a banquet of communion with God and all God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beloved (Mt 8:11, 22:2). What happens when, thinking of a penitential aspect of sacrifice, we lose sight of the sublime aspect of eat-ing and drinking? One answer is that then we cannot fully engage in the divine mystery of our Christian sac-rifice. We would even act contrary to the spirit of the sacrifice when we are not celebrating the Liturgy for-mally. The Corinthians did this, as Paul reminded them. When they came together for the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper, they did not wait for the Lord. Paul says: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"When you meet together, it is not the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Co 11:20-21). To spell out an implication in Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, ordinary human meals should be much like the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper. There is or should be etiquette and the spirit of sacrifice in every ordinary meal. 361 68.4 2009 Dominic * How You Eat Matters 362 The Hindu version of what happens when we do not honor the sacrificial aspect of human eating is best illustrated by a Hindu story. A man sought to know from a Hindu priest the greatest being in the universe worthy of a sacrifice. Following the clear instruction, he began offering food to the newly acquired idol in his house. One day he found a rat eating the offering. Inferring that the rat must be greater than the idol, he began making his sacrificial offering to the rat, till one day he saw a cat threatening the rat. So he began mak-ing his sacrifice to the cat. One day the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife saw the cat on an eating spree in the kitchen and chased it away with a stick2 Made aware of this greater power of his wife, he began making his sacrifice to her. Then one day, finding the meal she cooked and served too salty, he shouted at her. She quivered at his anger. That encounter made him feel superior to his wife, and so he began to offer food sacrificially to himself. He ate and ate until he died. Can anyone be so foolish? Not in such an obvious way, but most of us are probably about half that foolish. The really wise, of course, would know how to enjoy food and drink while recognizing that they are also part of the grateful sacrifice due to God. There is something beautiful and divine in such sacrifice pervading daily life without formal rubrics and yet illumining the rubrics of the altar. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Co 10:31). Notes ~ There was a similar first occurrence of prayer, this one in Sanskrit, spoken by a Hindu in the Nevada State Assembly on 19 March 2007 and in the Nevada State Senate on 7 May 2007, both in Carson City.

Fifteen years later, for many religious congregations, the window of opportunity appears to have closed. Few if any of their members are under the age of sixty\\\\\", \\\\\"no one has entered for ten or even twenty years\\\\\", \\\\\"vocation directors are burned out or depressed. Many members coverdy believe--and some openly argue--that it is use-less and unethical to invite young people to enter. It is for these congregations, especially, that I am writing this article, but I offer it as well to communities which are in less dire straits. I. believe that both could profit from the following alternative. I would like to point out a different--and more sociologically feasible--path for the future of declining religious congregations. I do not see this as replacing traditional religious life--which is thriving on a smaller scale in some (but not all) of the CMSWR congregations in the United States, and on a larger scale in Africa and South Asia. There will always be a place in the church for the traditional model of religious life. But U.S. Catholic culture is no longer as hospitable to this model as it once was. If it were, several hundred, not a few dozen, traditional religious congregations would be springing up in this country, and they would be doubling in membership every decade. Such explosive growth was the norm for religious congregations founded in the 19th century, and it obviously is not happening today. This comparative lack of interest, however, does not indicate that present-day U.S. Catholics are unspiritual heathens. They simply are not attracted to the traditional model. I believe that American Catholicism would be bet-ter served if several other versions of religious life were also available to young Catholics. By\\\\\\\\\\\\\"other versions\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I 68.4 2009 tVittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window A social movement is a wave of beliefs and/or actions that sweeps large numbers of persons into working toward a specific goal. 366 do not mean the lifestyles currendy being modeled by most of the non-CMSWR religious congregations. These are faring even worse than the traditionalist orders in attracting new members. Their charisms are still beau-tiful and, for the most part, still valid in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world. But they are not being presented in a form that appeals to young Catholics today. Instead, I want to suggest a different strategy for handing on a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism to a new generation: starting one---or preferably severalmsocial-movement orga-nizations. To explain how this would work, I first need to define a few terms. Broadly considered, a social movement is a wave of beliefs and/or actions that sweeps large numbers of persons into working toward a specific goal. Examples are the civil-rights movement, the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement, the envi-ronmental movement, and the right-to-life movement. Each of these movements may con-tain dozens of separate social-movement organizations (SMOs) which focus on particular activities, particular groups of people, or particular issues related to the larger movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals. Thus, the environmental movement includes large organiza-tions like the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy, and Greenpeace and also many smaller groups that focus on saving the monarch butterfly, cleaning up a local river, opposing the dumping of toxic waste, and so forth.3 There have been religious social movements and, thus, religious social-movement organizations as well. In Review for Religious Protestantism, a succession of social movements called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Great Awakenings\\\\\\\\\\\\\" sparked a host of religious revival groups throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, several of which developed into full-fledged denominations such as the Mormons, the Seventh-Day Adventists, and the various Pentecostal churches. In Catholicism, waves of devotionalism swept through both 17th-century France and 19th-century North America,4 spinning off pilgrim-age societies, sodalities, and prayer groups devoted to particular saints, scapulars, or novenas. These were not .religious orders at their inception, but some later did develop in that direction. Other times they simply strengthened the existing orders. I am suggesting that religious congregations con-sciously try to foster something similar today. Most still have one or more members who are passionate about meeting some particular need in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world, be it sav-ing the environment, feeding the poor, sheltering home-less women and children, providing free medical care to the uninsured, or mentoring the spiritually searching,s Many of these members have already worked out a more or less specific theology to ground their activities and to explain how their passion fits with the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism. Some have recruited a corps of volunteers to help them in. their work. To paraphrase the famous line from MoliEre,6 they are already \\\\\\\\\\\\\"forming a religious SMO without knowing it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, these passionate members are often less connected to the rest of the con-gregation. For years, even decades, the other members may have left them alone to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"do their own thing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But it is only a small step from what these indi-vidual religious are already instinctively doing, for their congregation deliberately to form and maintain several SMOs to enflesh its charism for subsequent genera- 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window 368 tions. All that remains is to help each incipient group to articulate its identity publicly, to specify clearly its religious grounding in the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism, and to take specific steps to ensure its leadership continuity and stable membership. This might simply involve: \\xc2\\xaf Picking a name connected with both the charism of the congregation and the specific focus of the group: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vincentian Servants of the Homeless,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Franciscan Brothers and Sisters of the Earth,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Centering Pray-ers,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and so forth. \\xc2\\xaf Adopting an identifiable sign of group affiliation, for example, a common T-shirt or a medal. \\xc2\\xaf Maintaining a public-relations effort to inform potential volunteers, donors, other members of the con-gregation, and the church at large about the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence and to attract them to its mission. \\xc2\\xaf Spelling out the criteria for entering and exiting the group, expectations of membership, and ongoing group governance. Previous evidence indicates that, paradoxically, groups with more rigorous expectations are more likely to succeed than those which demand less of their adherents.7 The first two steps are relatively simple, and may already have been taken. But they are not enough. Unless some provision is made for the continuance of the SMO, it may not survive its founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement. The founding brother or sister may be neither inter-ested in nor skilled at such bureaucratic maintenance activities. For the remaining steps, therefore, a religious congregation may be able to offer valuable help from its communications office (for the third task), and its leadership (for the fourth). The kind of social-movement organization I am advocating may or may not be represented by a con- Review for Religious gregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associate program. A congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associ-ates could certainly be this kind of group--but only if they are organized around a readily articulated spiri-tual focus and/or apostolic activity that distinguishes associate membership from the larger call given to any Catholic. Simply stating that associates are devoted to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"living the charism of the founder\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not enough. The more focused the associates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitment--whether in monthly or weekly prayer/lectio according to the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirituality, or in working on a regular basis with the vowed members in their ministry, or in staffing some auxiliary ministry that complements that of the vowed members--the more my SMO proposal here can be applied to them. Otherwise, an associateprogram will not be sufficiendy distinct from the lifestyle of non-associates to enflesh the order\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism on its own. Advantages of the SMO Model I am suggesting that some congregations--especially those whose members have tacitly abandoned the hope of attracting new vowed members--make a point of acknowledging this and then start to recruit people for their present members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 particular SMOs. What would be the advantages of such a strategy? First of all, any given religious congregation will survive only to the extent that its members are passionately devoted to some particular version of their founding charism. The future of religious life does not rest with the tired or apathetic, but after a long period of decline many religious now are both. Most congregations have only a few members with the needed passion and enthusiasm. Moreover, these members may not all be focused on the same passion. Some may live and breathe God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call to serve the poor\\\\\", \\\\\"others may devote their energies to preserving God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window Any given religious congregation will survive only to the extent that its members are passionately ~devoted to some particular version of their founding charism. 370 creation through environmental activities\\\\\", \\\\\"still others, with a more contemplative bent, may foster spirituality through centering prayer, pastoral counseling, or reli-gious art or music. A religious order faced with only a handful of healthy and passionate vowed members, each deeply devoted to a different passion, faces a serious dilemma. It can either focus on one of these passions to the exclu-sion of the others (which would be profoundly alien-ating to those left out), or it can try to include all of them (which dilutes the con-gregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spe-cific identity and its ability to rally its members around a common goal). Either way, a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to recruit to vowed membership is weakened if its remaining passion-ate members are devoted to different articulations of its charism, because its overall corporate mission identity will be weak.8 In contrast, enfleshing these articulations in several different SMOs would strengthen a congregation and improve the chances for its charism to survive. Since each SMO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participants are not necessarily vowed to the congregation, it is not only possible but desirable that several could exist under the same congregational \\\\\\\\\\\\\"rOOfo\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x999 The more different SMOs a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members \\\\\\\\\\\\\"spin off,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the greater the chance that one, at Review for Religious least, will catch fire. As I will argue below, this may then become the seed for the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future. A second advantage of the SMO approach is that it is a sociologically feasible way of incorporating temporary members or inviting specific demographic groups into the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family. The prospect of temporary membership in permanently vowed religious congrega-tions has been discussed for over thirty years without ever coming to fruition.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xb0 This is probably a sign that the concept is unworkable. A host of decisions would need to be faced in a congregation that included both permanent and temporary members: financial expec-tations, for example, or voice and vote in chapters. Maintaining a distinction between the two groups could imply a second-class status for the temporary members\\\\\", \\\\\"erasing the distinction would depreciate the perpetually vowed members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitment. Also, there is not now and never has been any indi-cation that large numbers of potential entrants are clamoring for the option of temporary membership in communities with perpetual vows. If anything, the opposite is the case. In contrast, however, various lay movements that are similar to SMOs are thriving in the church--which may be a sign that the model is a more compatible and sociologically viable Way of enfleshing a religious call in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world.\\xe2\\x80\\x991 Lay social-movement organizations are compat-ible with temporary commitment. In fact, many actu-ally expect that their members will stay no more than three or four years. Prayer or volunteer groups specifi-cally targeting high school or college students would be examples of these. A recently begun group is the St. Joseph of Arimathea Society--groups of high school students in Cleveland and Louisville who help provide 371 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window A final advantage of religious \\xc2\\xaf social-movement organizations is that it is less devastating for the members if they dissolve. dignified and reverent funeral services for homeless peo-ple, and for murder victims and deceased old and young people whose relatives are too few or too devastated to arrange a funeral themselves. The students provide sing-ers and pallbearers, tend the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"potter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s field\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cemetery, and collect money for flowers and grave markers. More traditional examples of student organiza-tions include prayer groups (Athletes for Christ, rosary or adoration societies) or twinning arrange-ments with a school in a poor area. There is no expectation that the students will remain members of these groups after their graduation, although they may be directed to affiliated adult groups which they may or may not choose to join. A final advantage of religious social-movement orga-nizations is that it is less devastating for the members if they dissolve. While no data exist on the number of failed attempts that preceded or accompanied the suc-cessful founding of religious orders in previous centu-ries, anecdotal evidence in our histories indicates that at least as many attempts to found religious orders have failed as succeeded. This appears to be true today as well. Of the 97 new religious communities listed in the 1999 Directory of Embrging Religious Communities, 24 had dissolved by 2006, and another 21 had lost members.~2 Founding or truly refounding a religious order is a chancy business, and those who commit their lives to one of these new groups risk losing both financial security Review for Religious and mental/emotional health if they fail. Committing oneself to an SMO carries with it many fewer risks. Outcomes For those religious who are concerned for the pres-ervation of their congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism, forming one or more SMOs could have several beneficial results: \\xc2\\xaf Social-movement organizations may be effective recruit-ment vehicles for vowed membership. With few religious teaching in Catholic schools, most young Catholics have never seen a sister or brother. And few religious inter-act with anyone younger than fifty on a deep or regu-lar basis. How can young Catholics join a lifestyle they know so little about? How can religious invite those they never see? Participating with vowed religious on an ongoing basis in a soup kitchen, a prayer group, or an ecological project will help young people get to know the religious involved--and vice versa. \\xc2\\xaf One particular social-movement organization may develop into the vehide that will carry a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism into the next generation, after all of the former vowed mem-bers are gone. If so, this would finally realize the inclusive \\xc2\\xaf scenario that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Transformative Elements\\\\\\\\\\\\\" painted for the future of religious life twenty years ago. How could anyone say that a religious charism was extinct if, instead of a small number of vowed religious, an SMO of married, single, Catholic, and non-Catholic men and women were living it out by feeding the hungry, praying a particular devotion, tutoring poor children, or in some other way were bringing the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original vision into the 21st century? \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Life is not ended, merely changed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\xc2\\xaf A truly successful social-movement organization will often, however, contain a number of members who do want to devote their entire lives to its vision. It may 373 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window be that these members will not join the original community, but will instead begin a new one. If the first community is still around at this point, their wisdom and experi-ence would be invaluable for the new group. If not, the stories of the SMO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original founder--the sister who started a free clinic in Appalachia, the brother whose soup kitchen mobilized a city to feed the poor--will serve as a template. After all, Frederick Ozanam (the founder of the St. Vincent de Paul Society) lived sev-eral centuries after Vincent himself. St. John Bosco had never met St. Francis de Sales. Throughout the millennium and a half that Catholic religious life has existed, many new religious orders or lay groups have been formed from old templates. SMOs could provide templates of this very kind. Next Steps I believe that social-movement organizations could be useful, both for religious congregations that have given up on recruiting vowed members, and also for more-viable communities that still attract some young people. For the former, it may be the last remaining way they have of passing on their charism to a new genera-tion. For the latter, it may help them attract even more new entrants. The next steps I would suggest to con-gregations wishing to found such organizations--or to foster the ones their individual members have already begun--are as follows: \\xc2\\xaf Take inventory of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society: What are its deep-est needs or desires? As I have noted previously,~3 the best way to determine these needs is to look at what larger social movements are currently growing. The most pressing social movements reveal themselves by the large number of SMOs they spawn. Are there already Review for Religious a lot of small environmental groups? Prayer groups? Adoration groups? Groups working with the poor? Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s groups? Check out the directory of associa-tions on the Internet Public Library (http://www.ipl. org/div/aon/)to find out. Is there room for another SMO, locally, in this movement? For example, is there a group that the movement currently does not reach, such as Hispanics or high school youth? Is there a new tactic or way of addressing the issue that existing SMOs do not use? Could adding your congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirituality or charism deepen commitment to the social movement? \\xc2\\xaf Take inventory of your congregation: Who are your passionate members? What are their passions? How, if at all, do these passions relate to the charism of your founder? What larger social movements do these pas-sions relate to? Are your community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passionate mem-bers interested in leading or organizing a group to assist them in their work? Or, better, have they already done so? Are other members in your congregation interested in helping them? \\xc2\\xaf What does the group still need in order to succeed? Does it need to expand its pool of potential volunteers? Secure more stable funding? Plan for the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement? What is the optimum size for the group? Would expansion be good for it--or dilute its unique character? If the latter, can the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s model be \\\\\\\\\\\\\"fran-chised\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in some way, with separate independent chap-ters in various cities?14 \\xc2\\xaf What assistance can the congregation render? Can your communications office help to publicize the group? Can your vocation personnel and/or associates help locate new volunteers? Does the group need a place to meet? Need mentoring in finances or grant writing? What about retreats or prayer days on the charism? And 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window 376 who in the congregation could provide these services? A weakness in any new religious organization is its \\\\\\\\\\\\\"liabil-ity of newness,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which may lead to mistakes that imperil its very survival. A more experienced mentor could be a tremendous help. It is obvious by now that religious life is at the end of one of the cyclic downturns which have recurred over the centuries. Rather than resign ourselves to our \\\\\\\\\\\\\"inev-itable\\\\\\\\\\\\\" extinction--and thereby create a self-fulfilling prophecy--I think we should notice that the SMO model offers a way to midwife the new forms of religious life that will thrive and grow in the years ahead. The many permutations of this model already appearing--associ-ate programs, lay ecclesial movements, mixed emerg-ing communities--are foreshadowings, I believe, of an absorbing future. This is true even if most of them fail, as new ventures often do. More will continue to spring up until some \\\\\\\\\\\\\"get it right.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" With their centuries-long experience and the passions of at least some of their vowed members, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religious congregations could help in this rebirth. Notes ~ David Nygren and Miriam D. Ukeritis, The Future of Religious Orders in the United States: Transformation and Commitment (Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1993). 2 A good example would be the third and fourth of the so-called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Transformative Elements\\\\\\\\\\\\\" developed by the joint CMSM/LCWR meet-ing in Louisville in 1989--and cited on pp. 255 and following of Nygren and Ukeritis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book. Supposedly, this is what religious life would look like in the year 2010. In hindsight, it reflects more wishful thinking than any real-world trends for vowed religious life. 3 Fora fuller discussion of social movements and social-movement organizations, see my Pathways to Re-Creating Religious Communities (Mahwah: Paulist Press, 1996), chap. 4. 4 See Elizabeth Rapley, The D~votes: Women and Church in Seventeenth Review for Religious Century France (Montreal: McGill-Queens University Press, 1990), and Anne Taves, The Household of Faith: Roman Catholic Devotions in Nineteenth Century America (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), for these waves of devotionalism. s My own congregation has individual sisters--of whom I am extremely proud--deeply involved in all of these activities. 6 Or maybe not so famous--the citation refers to a line from Moli~re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comedy Le bourgeois gentilhomme, in which a nouveau riche man is being tutored in literature and discovers that he has been speak-ing prose all of his life without knowing it. 7 See, e.g., Rodney Stark and Roger Finke, Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), chap. 7. 8 According to the Nygren and Ukeritis study, mission identity is the principal variable influencing a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success (see pp. 97-98). 9 Several religious families have known this instinctively. For exam-ple, my own Vincentian tradition includes, not only the Congregation of the Mission, the Daughters of Charity, and the various Sister of Charity Federation congregations, but also the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Ladies of Charity, Vincentian Marian Youth, the Association of the Miraculous Medal, and the Missionary Cenacle, all of which are move-ment organizations of nonvowed laypersons. Similarly the Salesian family includes, not only the Salesian priests and Visitation nuns, but other vowed religious such as the Sisters of Mary Help of Christians, the Missionaries of St. Francis, the Salesian Missionaries of Mary Immaculate, and the Oblate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales, plus lay groups such as the Association of St. Francis de Sales and the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales. to I am not referring here to societies of apostolic life like the Daughters of Charity, who make annual vows, but rather to including an option for temporary membership in congregations whose members are now expected to make perpetual vows. Moreover, even among the Daughters of Charity, there is the assumption that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual vows are really for life. ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99 According to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA), Emerging Communities of Consecrated Life in the United States (Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 2006, p. 16), ten of the twelve most rapidly growing new indigenous emerging communities in the U.S. are mixed communities with some, or all, lay members. t2 CAP, A, Emerging Communities, p. 16. 377 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New V~ndow ,3 Wittberg, Pathways, pp. 80-85. ,4 The above-mentioned St. Joseph of Arimithea Society seems to operate through \\\\\\\\\\\\\"franchises\\\\\\\\\\\\\"--the Cleveland and Louisville chapters appear to be separate from each other.

CLARK Revisiting Religious Identity mnthe years following the Second Vatican Council, uch attention was focused on changes in religious life. Much writing and much effort have been directed toward rethinking or reimaging religious life. In light of all that, one might be tempted to say \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Enough already!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" An old saying has it that familiarity breeds contempt. Familiarity can also breed complacency and neglect. It might be good, then, to look once again at what it means to be a religious, to reflect on our religious iden-tity. Besides the decree on the renewal of religious life, Perfectae caritatis, Vatican Council II also spoke of the role of religious in Lumen gentium, the dogmatic con-stitution on the church. In chapter 6, \\xc2\\xa744, we read that the religious state \\\\\\\\\\\\\"manifests in a special way that the kingdom of God and its high requirements transcend all earthly considerations, bringing home to all people William P. Clark OMI, longtime teacher and administrator, lives at St, Henry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Oblate Residence\\\\\", \\\\\"200 North 60th Street\\\\\", \\\\\"Belleville, Illinois 62223. 379 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity the immeasurable greatness of the power of Christ in his sovereignty and the infinite might of the Holy Spirit marvelously working in the church.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The council is simply saying religious life gives special witness that, above and beyond earthly values, there is something we call the kingdom of God. While religious life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s characteristic witness is spe-cial, it is not exclusive. It is the duty of all Christians to give witness to the kingdom of God. All Christians, be they lay or religious, are committed to living out their baptismal consecration. Emphasis on the common voca-tion of all Christians highlights what is of fundamental importance, the fullness of Christian life informed by charity. That emphasis also counteracts any tendency to draw unfavorable comparisons between the lay and religious states, as though laypersons are somehow sec-ond- class citizens or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"children of a lesser God.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That broad emphasis on all Christian life is rooted in the most ancient tradition of monasticism. In his masterful study The Spirituality of the New Testament and the Fathers, Louis Bouyer finds certain constants in the literature of monasticism. He affirms them because they were some-what obscured by later developments. One such insight is that the primitive monk did not appear special. Whether by himself or others, his vocation was not considered par-ticular or exceptional. The monk was simply a Christian, a devout layperson who took the most radical means to live the Christian life to the fullest. The monk proposed no other end than to be saved. All his life, the monk asked for no other teaching from his elders than the means of attaining that goal. His fundamental and persistent ques-tion was: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tell me. How can I be saved?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Two points need emphasis. First, holiness, the fullness of Christian life, is not something reserved Review for Religious to religious, while laypersons are called to something less. Second, religious are to focus on the essential, on the search for union with God, and not see holi-ness as something incidental or distinctive which sets them apart from \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ordinary\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Christians. Fundamental to religious identity is one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity as a Christian. It is the fullness of the Christian experience that constitutes Christian identity. There are three major elements in the Christian expe-rience. The first is not distinctively Christian. It is the human preamble. It consists in discovering that human happiness and fulfillment are not brought about by tak-ing. We all start out that way, looking for that certain something or combination of things which, if we could only latch on to it and make it our own, would provide fulfillment. The Christian experience becomes possible once we realize that what we really seek is something or someone to give ourselves to, something or someone greater and nobler than ourself. It is a search for some-thing or someone that will endow our life with meaning and purpose. Finding that something or someone is the beginning of faith as a lived reality. It becomes the basis of all commitment worthy of the name. The second element makes the experience specifi-cally Christian. It consists in finding that greater-than-self reality in the person of Jesus Christ. It is finding in his words meaning for our life. It is finding in his life the pattern and model for our own. The third element is the desire to share what we have found. We want others to find the meaning and purpose that have become our own. We want to live out this meaning and purpose in love for one another. The full Christian experience, then, is apostolic and missionary. 381 68.4 2009 Clark * Revisiting Reli#ous Identity 382 If this Christian experience is not real in our lives, no amount of theorizing about what it is or should be will ever make it so. Furthermore, theorizing will not help much in our lives as religious. If the Christian experience is real, it can be progressively liberating, freeing from all those attitudes of mind and spirit that limit us to operating within the narrow confines of self-ish interests. Like all Christians, religious are to give witness by their lives to the possibilities open to everyone for liber-ation from enslaving attitudes like inordinate ambition, defensiveness, possessiveness, self-pity, and cynicism. The life of religious should also be an active witness to joy, to hope, and to love. The call to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity seems so daunting that peo-ple often try to evade its challenge. In doing so, lay-persons sometimes say that holiness is something for religious and priests, not for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ordinary\\\\\\\\\\\\\" persons like themselves. Likewise, religious sometimes find a type of escape through dependence on the system. Religious life involves a kind of system that includes public vows, constitutions and rules, and a goodly number of prac-tices found in the traditions of various religious insti-tutes. We might think just plugging into the system will make us as holy as we need to be. It is easy to just coast along. All too easily we can come to rate as virtue whatever is conformable to our religious surroundings. Custom and routine can so enslave us as to dispense us from personal decision. Of course, custom and routine, as well as the regular practices and exercises of religious life, are also great helps--if we understand and use them righdy. They do not, however, carry us all the way. They reflect the fact Review for Religious that in choosing to be religious we have set the direction of our lives. But they do not guarantee we never lose that direction. The need for ongoing renewal is simply the need to reaffirm, to reset our direction. The human condition is such that nothing can be taken for granted except the constancy of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace, of his invitation. Another point on which the council spoke explic-itly is religious consecration. Everyone of the faithful is consecrated to the divine service by baptism. Clearly, in various contexts the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consecration\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has various meanings, causing difficulties to be raised about how this idea applies to religious. In address-ing those difficulties, the council begins by relating religious con-secration to baptism. Religious consecra-tion adds nothing to the baptism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sacramental character. It is, however, in the line of baptismal grace. That grace can be lived in varying degrees of intimacy. The coun-cil speaks of religious as being \\\\\\\\\\\\\"more intimately conse-crated to the divine service.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That phrase is significant. It does not say \\\\\\\\\\\\\"more strictly\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or anything that might seem to emphasize some form of legal obligation. What the council points out by those words is that baptismal consecration can be interiorized to a greater or lesser extent by grace and by love. Ultimately, the truth of every Christian life consists in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s baptismal consecration. But God calls people to live out that consecration in different ways. For religious The call to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity seems so daunting that people often try to evade its challenge. 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity the call to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service is more explicitly determined. It takes on a particular form or style. To put that a bit differently, for religious the vital response called for by God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loving initiative is made concrete in a specific and distinctive way. By making a certain explicit profession of the evan-gelical counsels, persons technically become religious. The purpose of such profession is to commit ourselves more explicitly and more profoundly to living our bap-tismal consecration. At one time religious profession was commonly called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"a new baptism\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in homilies at profession ceremonies. In those days it was not always adequately explained. The council statements revitalized and clarified that idea. In reflecting on religious consecration, it is important to realize that such consecration is the work of God. Virtually every page of Scripture speaks of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initiative in regard to creatures. Jesus told his disciples: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"You have not chosen me. I have chosen you.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Passages like that have a particular resonance for religious. It is God who calls religious and consecrates them through the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ministry. Because it is God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work, religious consecration is permanent. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice and God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fidelity are unchanging. God is constant in the grace he offers, in his call. Our challenge is to keep trying to respond generously to that call. Religious consecration represents a special instance of the mysterious interaction between grace and human freedom. Obviously it is essential that those consecrat-ing themselves to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service be free. At the same time we must recognize that the consecration is ulti-mately God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. Religious profession has never been considered a sacrament by the church. In recent years many things have been referred to as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sacraments,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in a broad sense Review for Religiot~s of the word. In the strict sense, religious profession is not a sacrament. That does not mean, however, that religious profession has no reality beyond the disposi-tion and conduct of the subject. Religious consecration is something accorded to free persons precisely as free. To be received, the consecra-tion requires a personal response to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call. That response includes certain characteristics. It must be sufficiently enlightened, conscious, and free. A person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention and the vows which formulate that intention are eminently free acts. Conversely, when the church dispenses from vows, she judges that in reality there was some impediment to freedom in the original profes-sion, something lacking in what was offered for divine consecration. The fact that religious consecra-tion is not a sacrament does not mean nothing more is involved than the liberty of the one making vows. On God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part the engagement is indefectible. A vocation consists in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being called to a cer-tain manner of life. Each vocation has its own structure and laws. Those laws are not to be understood as some-thing imposed from the outside. They derive from the very nature of the life in question. To ignore structure and laws proper to religious life would be to think of reli-gious life as funny putty which can take on any shape one gives it. History shows significant variations in the forms of religious life. But, in the last analysis, that life must always be directly related to what is most fundamental in Christianity, the search for God and growth in charity. A vocation consists in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being called to a certain manner of life. 68.4 2009 Clark * Revisiting Religious Identity In the Christian understanding of life, the goal is progress in charity. Jesus made it clear that love of God and love of neighbor sum up the whole law. Love gives ultimate value to what we do. That is why religious con-secration is wholly directed towards love of God and neighbor. It is precisely that love which gives the value of consecration to the activity of the religious. The idea that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities must continuously be animated by charity is certainly not new. We have heard it countless times in one form or another. Nor is it distinctive. It is true for everyone. By religious profession we are committed to that goal more explicitly, more officially, as it were. On the part of religious, the consecration of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life consists in using distinctive means for achieving the common Christian goal of progress in charity. My cir-cumstances, my state of life, determine the means that are most appropriate for me. Jacques Maritain offered an excellent definition of means. He said means are the end in the process of coming to be. Thus, at each moment of our journey toward the perfection of love, we make that end real by employing the appropriate means, Perhaps we should emphasize the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"journey.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" While we hope we are on the right road and we try to keep moving in the right direction, we never reach the end, the perfection of love, in this life. Another way to put that is to say that holiness is not so much a place we arrive as it is the way we travel. Consciousness of our shortcomings and failures makes us reluctant to think of ourselves as holy. A num-ber of years ago Archbishop John Roach of St. Paul, in a pastoral letter on spirituality titled A Friendship Unlimited, offered a valuable insight in this regard. He wrote: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a funny thing, but for years I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imag- Review for Religious ine thinking of myself as holy. I was equating holiness with perfection, and I knew I simply didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that. It is clear to me now that holiness is the desire to be a friend of Jesus Christ and to surrender my will to God. I may stumble along with that. I have so far--but, so long as I continue a sincere effort toward that goal, I am holy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It might help also to remind ourselves of one charac-teristic of holiness that is often overlooked. It is compat-ible with human frailty. Many stories and most statues of saints give a wrong impression, an impression of otherworldliness that obscures the fact that those saints were real human beings with human faults and weak-nesses. Examples are plentiful. St. Augustine was given to rages. St. Thtr~se of Lisieux had bouts of depression. St. Vincent de Paul, the great saint of charity, was said to be bilious and subject to fits of anger. St. Jerome was aggressive and insulting to persons who disagreed with him. In fact, one of his contemporaries said of Jerome that his malice was such that no saint could live within miles of him. The secret of all of those people is that they never gave up struggling and working to overcome their human weaknesses. They knew what counts is not the triumphant victory of total perfection, but persevering effort. Teresa of Avila said we should strive and strive and strive, for we were made for nothing else. She was right, of course, but the way she said it makes it sound hard. And it is a constant challenge. We cannot gloss over that. But I like the way T.S. Eliot put it when he said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are only undefeated because we keep 6n trying.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In question 186 of the Secunda Secundae of his Summa Theologiae, St. Thomas treats of things that per-tain to the religious state. He speaks at length of the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and argues their ,387 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity necessity for religious perfection. He points out that \\\\\\\\\\\\\"a person cannot offer his whole life to God directly because that life is not lived all at once, but only suc-cessively. Hence, a person can only offer his whole life to God through the obligation imposed by vows\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (my translation). Thus, our real challenge is not the perfor-mance of heroic acts, however beautiful, however noble, for every human act is by nature transitory. Our real challenge is the heroism of a whole life, offered to God without measure, without reservation, without regret. This is done through religious consecration, through the vows. And in this the entire person, mind and heart, must be involved and permanently involved. Note \\xe2\\x80\\x99 The Vatican translation and the revised Flannery translation, melded.

Review for Religious LEO J. HERIOT Encounters Early and Late: John Bosco and Paul Saul was present at the stoning of the lov-able Stephen, and perhaps this increased the Pharisee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire for Christian blood. Fernand Prat says, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Not content with being present at the torture of the victims, he entered into houses and dragged out the inmates, both men and women, to hale them to the dungeons.\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Saul set out on the trail of Christians not to evangelize them but in pursuit of them to bring them to what he thought was justice. He had asked the priests to give him the offi-cial mission to seek out Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disciples in the synagogue of Damascus and drag them before the Sanhedrin. In the Acts of the Apostles we have three accounts of the vision on the way to Damascus (9:1-19\\\\\", \\\\\"22:3-21\\\\\", \\\\\"26:12-20). It is Luke who makes the first announcement of Leo J.

The accounts agree on the important points: the occa-sion, the place, the time of day, the dazzling light, Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fall to the ground, his dialogue with the mysterious voice, his blindness, the return of his sight, and the total change in his life. From being a firebrand of a persecutor, he became a sower of the Good News of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The whole change of his behavior, his heeding of the strong voice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, and his subsequent dedica-tion to a new cause make us aware that he was not led by fanaticism or goaded on by personal ambition. Jesus Christ seized him, pulled him close to himself. From the accounts of this conversion, nothing presaged it, noth-ing hinted that the fierce Pharisee would change regard-ing this person Jesus Christ, changing and becoming a disciple of Jesus and a preeminent apostle. Looking at this conversion, one gets the impression that it is beyond human explanation. It would be folly to try to find some simple plausible human causality. Pauline theology gives pride of place to the empow-erment of grace, and Saul was certainly under the influence of grace. It is not possible to explain this con-version apart from divine grace. Paul helps us with these assertions from his writings: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Have I not seen Jesus, our Lord?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Co 9:1). \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Last of all, as one untimely born, he appeared also to me\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Co 15:8). Grace found in this man fertile soil that would produce a great extension of the stoW of Jesus, a stoW that would make people aware of the immense, unfolding gift God gave to Saul and to the world on Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way to Damascus. Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encounter with the risen Lord as he sought to obliterate that Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message had a huge influence on him. One of the Apostle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boldest and most profound Review for Religious teachings was that of Christians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 being incorporated into Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mystical body. For this Pharisee, Paul, Christ becomes all in all\\\\\", \\\\\"Christ becomes everything. This idea is contained in seminal form in the question Jesus puts to the blinded Saul: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ac 9:4). Paul was not attacking Jesus directly\\\\\", \\\\\"he was defending his Pharisaism by trying to prevent Jews from falling into the ways of this crucified \\\\\\\\\\\\\"reformer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of Judaism. In Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversion God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace is evident, work-ing a transformation immediately. It is like the blinding flash of light. The extraordinary illumination appar-ently brought about Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate com-pliance with Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 words and his swift transformation into a disciple and apostle. The stunned Saul changed his course once and for all. He found himself in a new world, a world almost alien to the life he had lived until then. Paul was overwhelmed by a new faith, a belief in the person of Jesus Christ as his Lord and master. He began a new and demanding life that only a strong and deep faith and love could sustain. He expresses that faith in his Letters to the Galatians and the Romans, an active faith that revolutionizes the whole person and alters the direction of people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives. From the moment of his conversion the gaze of Saul is riveted on the person of Jesus Christ. We would go too far, however, if we reduced Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to the moment One of the Apostle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boldest and most profound teachings was that of Christians\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being incorporated into Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mystical body. 391 68.4 2009 Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Encounters Early and Late of his conversion. His continuing deep reflection on the mystery of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love strengthened him as he went about his apostolic life. Our beliefs, too, are not simply the result of our reading or reflection, but come from God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communication with us, often in the quiet con-templation of a Divine Master stretching out his hand to us and telling us to find him in our contemplative awareness of others and ourselves. 392f The Boy from Becchi, Another Man of Zeal In an audience on 21 March 1858, Pope Pius IX, now Blessed, told the priest from Turin: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"When you get back to Turin, Don Bosco, you write down these dreams and everything else you have told me, minutely, and in their natural sense. Save all this as a legacy for your Congregation so that it may serve as an encouragement and norm for your Sons.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x992 After nine years this same pope questioned him once again. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply was \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I truthfully lacked the time. I was so taken with [any number of things].\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The pope said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Well then, I not only advise you, but order you to do it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Don Bosco promised to write down his early experiences, and he kept his word.3 In his poor handwriting Don Bosco scrawled out his first dream. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"At the age of nine I had a dream that really changed my life and influenced me throughout my life. I dreamed I was near my house at Becchi, and a crowd of young boys had gathered there to have fun and play games. Some were playing, some were laughing, and not a few were cursing. Shocked by their expres-sions, I jumped in among the boys, swinging wildly and shouting at them to stop saying those things. At that moment a Person appeared among us. He was dressed in a long white robe, and his face radiated such light Review for Religious that I could not look at it. Suddenly he called me by name. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Giovanni, you have to win these boys not by blows but with gendeness and kindness (bont~). So begin right now to show them that evil is ugly and virtue is beautiful.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Although these words confused him, this little boy, nine years old in 1824, was being commissioned for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. He said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am so small and these are young men. What you are asking me to do seems to be impos-sible.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But he was told: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"What seems so impossible, you must achieve by being obedient and acquiring knowledge.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The boy shouted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"You ask me to do the impossible!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The voice said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a teacher under whose guid-ance you will learn and without whose help all knowl-edge becomes foolishness.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Beside this Person stood the Lady to whom young Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother had taught him to pray regularly. The Lady, taking his hand, said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Giovanni, look carefully. What do you see?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The crowd of boys was changed into goats, dogs, cats, bears, and various other animals. The Lady of his dream said to him, startlingly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is your field of labor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Then she gave him a one-word recipe for getting these boys to improve: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"amorevolezza\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (loving concern). The wild animals disappeared, having been turned into sheep. The Lady then told him, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"In due time you will understand,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and with that she put her hand on his head. At table for morning coffee he told his family about his dream. Each one said something different. His \\\\\\\\\\\\\"At the age of nine I had a dream that really changed my life and influenced me throughout my life.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 393 68.4 2009 Heriot * Encounters Early and Late brother Joseph said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh, Giovanni, you are going to become a farmer looking after sheep and goats, caring for them.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" His brother Anthony said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh, Giovanni, you are going to become the leader of a gang of ban-dits!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After other such remarks, their wise old grand-mother said in an authoritarian tone: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Giovanni, take no notice of dreams.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And Mama Margaret said con-vincingly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prepare yourself, Giovanni, for your future apostolate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This, then, is what Pope Pius IX referred to in 1858 when he told Don Bosco: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is the begin-ning and the foundation of your work. Give this dream to your Congregation and make it a part of their life.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" On the road to Damascus, Paul was astonished by the voice that changed his life. It had the power to change his life and send him on a new mission. While any comparison of nine-year-old John Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream to Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience near Damascus would be lopsided, we may remind ourselves that both of them were impelled into a new life, a new apostolate, by mysterious expe-riences beyond usual explanation. Are there not many other divinely wondrous experiences as well? Why not keep them in mind?

After I entered, the prioress asked me to choose a patron, and I chose St. Hilda of Whitby. Initially I hesitated to choose her because, generally speaking, we do not know much about her. We know when she was born and died, where she lived, and some of the activities she pursued, activities for which she was well known and respected. But we know little about her character, her spirit, or her inner life. How did the tone of a gathering change when she walked into a room? How did she regard those whose lives and souls were entrusted to her care? Was her glance warm or cool? Did she have a glint in her eye? Answers to these ques-tions seemed permanently unavailable.

Main Street\\\\\", \\\\\"Mt. Angel, Oregon 97362. Email: ajkjune@juno.com 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby a local, award-winning choir directed by Dr. Solveig Holmquist. I had been a student in her college choir for three years at Western Oregon University. I was excited to see her again, even from a distance, even from the back as she conducted the choir. When she entered the concert hall, she was as I had remembered--not tall or physically imposing, yet filled with a presence that shot through her spiky hair, her sharp eyes, and her earrings and many bracelets. I saw a woman in full possession of herself and the situation at hand. She stood before the choir and the orchestra, and they knew what to do sim-ply by the movements of her hands and a thin baton. I remembered standing before her with my eyes on every move she made. In every gesture, every expression, she embodied musician and conductor. She made the vocalists and musicians one as we let her lead us--as, with our minds but also our hearts, we let her be our breath to the very last note. When Dr. Holmquist arrived at Western, she had clearly learned how to draw people together. Shortly after being hired, she was told there were no students at Western who could really sing. Given that this was untrue, and even uncharitable, Dr. Holmquist did not listen. She simply set up a table at the activities fair at the beginning of the school year and started signing students up for auditions. By the end of the year, she had set the choral music program on its feet, doubling the size of the choir, planning tours, and establishing a student-led choir council. I began to see that music was Dr. Holmquist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, and part of that life was invit-ing the rest of us into the music in whatever way was appropriate for each of us. I loved her for it, and I still do. Though I do not think I would have used the word at the time, I see now Review for Religious that what I received from Dr. Holmquist was a deep and vigorous image of vocation. I have no doubt that through the music she is doing what God created her to do. Shortly before I graduated, I tried to say as much to her. In her office one morning, I described what I saw in her. I said I was not a born musician like her, but rather a writer and a reader, and I was looking for my own purpose in life. The day I attended the Festival Chorale concert was November 17th, the feast day of St. Hilda, and the first time I observed her feast day as my own. As I watched and remembered Dr. Holmquist, some of the reasons why I choose Hilda began to emerge. It was not about wanting to be an abbess as Hilda was, any more than it was about wanting to be a cho- , ral conductor. It was not about imitation in such a specific sense, but about living in the presence of someone who could play a part in calling me to be who I am supposed to be and to do what I am meant to do. It was about the profound effect just one person who is living her vocation may have on those around her. If I imagined myself as a member of Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monastery, much as I had been a member of Dr. Holmquist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choir, what could I learn about who I am supposed to be here and now? It was about the profound effect just one person who is living her vocation may have on those around her. 397 The Venerable Bede, an English monk and writer of the 8th century, is our sole source of historical infor- 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby marion on Hilda. After serving as the abbess of several monasteries, she established at Whitby a double monas-tery, a community of monks and nuns. In his history of the English church, Bede tells us she taught those within her community to study the Scriptures thoroughly, to observe good works, and to foster many virtues, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"but especially peace and charity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In part, the influence of her goodness was seen in the five outstanding men from her monastery who became bishops. In addition to her own monks and nuns, others from all walks of society sought her direction. In this way Hilda, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"whom all her acquaintances called Mother because of her wonderful devotion and grace,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" guided many people to God along the path of their particular gifts and circumstances. Bede also gives us the story of Caedmon, a shy sheep-herder whom \\\\\\\\\\\\\"God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace made remarkable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" One night Caedmon received a vision from God in which a man asked him to compose and sing him a song. Caedmon answered that he could not sing, and the man replied \\\\\\\\\\\\\"But you shall sing to me,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and he did, thus becom-ing the first poet of the English language. When Hilda learned of Caedmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gift, she invited him to become a monk and be instructed in sacred history, which he then rendered into beautiful music and poetry. Caedmon soon became not just a poet but a disciplined and beloved member of the community as well. At his death he asked if there were any who held any ill will against him, and he was assured that there was not. When then asked if he was at peace with those attending him, he replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am at peace with all the servants of God.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Among well-known events of church history, Whitby is known as the site of the synod in 664 at which the controversy between the Celtic and Roman dates for observing Easter was resolved. The problem disturbed Review for Religious many people, Bede tells us, even to the point that they feared \\\\\\\\\\\\\"that they might have received the name Christian in vain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Those arguing for the Roman date were victo-rious, yet Bede describes Hilda and her community as favoring the Celtic practice. While he tells us the results of the synod, Bede does not describe Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to the decision. We do not know if in the end she was saddened, relieved, or pleased. From what we do know about her leadership, however, we can perhaps assume that many looked to Hilda for guidance as to how they should respond to this decision. We can see the great respect she had for the Scriptures and the wisdom of the church. We can see that she taught those around her to be of service in all peace and charity. Even as she neared her death, she urged those in her monastery to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"maintain the gospel peace among themselves and with others.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I imagine that Hilda had a profound sense of perspective, of knowing, in the end, which beliefs and practices held priority. Unity within the church mat-tered more than any particular date, and gracious accep-tance of the decision of the synod mattered more than the content of the arguments. I was aware of St. Hilda before I was a Catholic because I attended St. Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Episcopal Church for sev-eral years during high school and college. St. Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is a small community\\\\\", \\\\\"the church holds perhaps fifty peo-ple on a Sunday. I met the vicar, Noel Knelange, when I first arrived, and about a year later Noel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband Bill was ordained a deacon. I attended the ordination and sang in the choir, helping to lead the congregation out of the church singing \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Highway\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the recessional. During the service I was taken aback 399 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Whitby Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordination gave me the image of dedicating one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to God alone, and Noel, bluntly and without~ pretense\\\\\", \\\\\"connected ~that image, to me, 400] by the beauty of the liturgy and the fact that Bill was grounding his life and identity in his faith. Somehow God wanted him. God wanted exactly who Bill was, a middle-aged man, a deaf man deeply involved with the deaf community of the diocese, a man who loved to fish so much that during the homily the bishop gave him a new fishing pole, now that he would be a fisher of men. Afterwards, during the reception in the parish hall, I was standing near Bill and Noel, probably eating a cookie, when Noel turned to me and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Well, you could do this too you know!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" What? I did not want to be a deacon or a priest. I did not understand why she said that, and we never talked about it later. I forgot about Noel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words until after I had become a Catholic and been a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel, Oregon, for several years--even though I had often wondered when the thought of becoming a nun first came to me. Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordination gave me the image of dedicating one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to God alone, and Noel, bluntly and without pretense, connected that image to me. The seed of the idea of staking everything on \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as we read in the Letter to the Hebrews, was planted and would take root in ways I never suspected. Just a few years Review for Religious later, I was led to the Catholic Church, to a Benedictine monastery, and to a surprising new relationship with St. Hilda, a relationship reflected in women like Solveig Holmquist and Noel Knelange. Regardless of whether they were aware of all the details, they could and would change the course of a life in a single breath, with a single word. The name Hilda comes from the Old English and means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Battle Maiden,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a fact I learned only after I received the official word from .the prioress that I could take Hilda as my new name at my final profession. I took to the image of the Battle Maiden immediately--the tension between toughness and gentleness, knowledge and innocence, between what we think we know and what we in fact do not, a tension not to be resolved but used as ingeniously as possible until the day of death. Other people have taken to my choice of the name Hilda, to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Batde Maiden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" too. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Battle on, maiden!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" says my mom before she hangs up the phone. After ask-ing me to explain the meaning of Hilda to my class-mates, one of my seminary professors warns that \\\\\\\\\\\\\"from now on, you gendemen better look out!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The best, how-ever, is my friend Ania. With her I have established The Society of Honorary Battle Maidens. We have taken as our charter the words of St. Paul to the Corinthians: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not driven to despair, persecuted, but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed, always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" To bet- 401 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby ter understand our society, I have listed qualities of the Battle Maiden, which include the following and will surely be added to as I ponder this further: \\xc2\\xaf A persistent love, grounded in the love of God that pursues us without end. She can keep extending her love for other people, regardless of how they respond, if at all. If she feels hurt by this, she takes it to mean that her efforts were not the most gracious way to love this particular person, and it is time to try something else. She is intelligent, so her persistence does not suggest beating her head against a wall, but rather keeping her wits about her and being willing, always willing, to try again. \\xc2\\xaf The beginning of an understanding of the fourth step of humility in the Rule of St. Benedict: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The fourth step of humility is that, in this obedience under diffi-cult, unfavorable, or even unjust conditions, his [or her] heart quietly embraces suffering and endures it without weakening or seeking escape.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" She does not, in the end, resent that this step asks her to endure injustice, even contradiction, for the sake of the God she loves. She accepts that sometimes such endurance will require her to speak her mind, to name what is difficult, recognizing that endurance can be more than just waiting for the bad to run its course. Bravery of heart becomes part of her core. She understands that false sisters and broth-ers (and are not we all false and contradictory at one time or another) are part of reality\\\\\", \\\\\"to deny this is of no use to anyone. She uses their words and actions to strengthen her reliance on the Lord so that it remains possible for her to pray for her enemies. \\xc2\\xaf An enduring kindness that she tries to exercise in any situation, par.ticularly in her words. At times, she may manifest her kindness in ways that are more tra- Review for Religious ditionally recognized as kindness--offering to lend a hand in household tasks, greeting guests with courtesy and assisting them in their needs, acknowledging the accomplishments of others with a sincere compliment. Kindness, however, is also needed in more challenging situations. It is a kindness to try to change the sub-ject when she hears murmuring or gossip about some-one who is not present. It is a kindness to walk away and not participate even by listening when this tactic fails, perhaps biting back the words rising in her throat that she would like to put everyone in their place with. Kindness calls her to address only in private any embar-rassing situations that involve another person, so as not to worsen the pain her words would likely cause if spo-ken publicly. To enjoy membership in The Society of Honorary Battle Maidens, you and I do not need to be in full possession of these qualities. We do need, however, to recognize their worth and strive to live with their inher-ent tensions, tensions that in the end are simply the tensions of the cross.

Teresa Burleson 403 68.4 2009 Vv\\xe2\\x80\\x99ILLIAM PROSPERO World Youth Day and Religious Life sharing experience 40_4] Many vocation directors will confirm that a substantial number of candidates for seminar-ies and institutes of consecrated life consider a World Youth Day (WYD) experience to have been an important part of their discernment. Many candidates say they first thought seri-ously about religious life or the priesthood while on a WYD pilgrimage. What is it about WYD that promotes consecrated life? Sister Joseph Andrew, of the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, asked me to speak about this very topic at a recent discernment retreat at the motherhouse in Ann Arbor. No less than a hundred \\xe2\\x80\\x99thirty young women attended. When I asked how many had been to WYD, about one third raised their hands. The main reason for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"only\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a third, I William Prospero SJ is pastor of St. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s University Parish (on the campus of Central Michigan University)\\\\\", \\\\\"1405 South Washington\\\\\", \\\\\"Mount Pleasant, Michigan 48858. Emaih will.prospero@stmarycmu.org Review for Religious believe, is that most of them were too young to have attended any other WYD than the one in 2008 in Sydney, Australia. Sydney did not draw huge numbers from the United States because of the travel cost. Nonetheless, many of the young women present had managed to attend that WYD. I believe there are several reasons why WYD pro-motes consecrated life and priesthood. Though I do not have any statistical analysis to prove my points, I have a wealth of experience assisting young WYD pil-grims in their discernment about consecrated life or priesthood. I have attended four WYDs: Denver (1993), Toronto (2002), Cologne (2005), and Sydney (2008). I have served as a priest on the last three. I have wit-nessed more than ten pilgrims enter religious life or the seminary. The main reason, I believe, for the wealth of WYD vocations is that WYD gives a taste of life as a conse-crated person. Pilgrims experience about two weeks of consecrated living. WYD provides a veritable \\\\\\\\\\\\\"trial run\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of living the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In. living the vows on WYD, pilgrims experience the intense joy of the universal church gathered around the pope. They make the connection that living as a religious could be enjoyable and meaningful. The possibility of consecrated vocation becomes real for the first time in many pilgrims\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. Pilgrims experience poverty the first day of com-mitting to go on WYD. They realize that the costs can be high. As I began recruiting for Sydney, I recall sev-eral students resisting, sa.ying $2,850 was too costly. My response was: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do you want to go? Has God put this desire in your heart? If so, then commit and the money will come. I promise. And, if not, I will personally cover 405 68.4 2OO9 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf World Youth Day and Religious Life Trusting God for material needs is a tangible experience of religious poverty. 406 whatever you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But you must promise you will com-mit to this and try your best to raise the funds. I prom-ise you, God will provide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Every pilgrim had enough funds. On four WYDs I have never met a pilgrim who fell short of funds. For the 2008 WYD in Sydney, we took seventy pilgrims from the Diocese of Saginaw, each paying $2,850. There are stories of pilgrims finding funds flow-ing in from fund-raisers and from the most unexpected sources. Trusting God for material needs is a tangible experience of reli-gious poverty: God provides. Pilgrims trust him, and all works out. From the beginning, they learn that those who commit to a reli-gious pilgrimage are cared for by God. They learn this throughout WYD, beginning with their first moment of commitment. Poverty finds many manifestations, usually very inconvenient ones. As the pilgrimage officially begins, I speak of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"great ball of suffering\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that one endures on WYD. For some reason, chaos and inconvenience reign. This makes trusting God mandatory, not optional. For example, because of delayed flights, our travel time from our departure to our host parish in Kiama, south of Sydney, was thirty-eight hours. And the last two hours were in a bus with a broken heater (it was winter there) while rain and forty Fahrenheit degrees of damp cold were welcoming us. These horrendous situations created the proper spirit in which to celebrate Mass, Revie\\\\\", \\\\\"v for Religious namely, our sense of spiritual and actual poverty: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are not in control!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Having celebrated Mass at a crowded boarding gate in the Los Angeles airport (LAX), we found special meaning in celebrating Mass again, hungry and cold, at the very end of our trip. I was reminded of the four thousand hungry and tired people in Mark 6:1-8 who were worn out from their journey, so Jesus fed them. It was as if Jesus intentionally brought the people out to a deserted place to experience their poverty and to see and taste the goodness of God. Poverty makes pilgrims hungry for Jesus. Another example of poverty happened at the Papal Welcome at Sydney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harbor. Afterwards we were hun-gry and cold. Several pilgrims collected our chits or tickets and got our meals, bags of hot stew (option: beef or pork). After getting the same victuals several days in a row, pilgrims were cheerfully dubbing them \\\\\\\\\\\\\"barf bags.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Our meals were being eaten on the ground or on cement blocks or wherever we could prop ourselves up. One night, however, several alert pilgrims found some plastic chairs and brought enough over for the group of seventy to sit. We could sit and eat! We were so grate-ful. I cannot recall ever feeling so grateful for having a chair to sit on. This is what WYD does: it makes the ordinary into a gift from God. Once one begins to see that everything, everything, is a gift, then one can start living a radical Christian life. So the gift of sitting, eat-ing, enjoying each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company, and basking in the reality that we just saw in person the Vicar of Christ, all add up to an explosive experience of the joys of the kingdom. Poverty makes human experience more real, and opens us to the true value of community. How sim-ple and uncomplicated it all is. 407 68.4 2009 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf Worm Youth Day and Religious Life Over and over one witnesses pilgrims making sacrifices for the sake of the group. 4081 If pilgrims are properly prepared and guided, they have a wonderful experience of interacting positively with the opposite sex. Even sleeping conditions, oth-erwise inappropriate, become an experience of intense respect and honor of boundaries. One sees the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"other\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as sacred and as a fellow pilgrim on the way, some-one to be honored and respected. I have never known of any of our pil-grims engaging in actions that are meant for mar-ried couples. Sleeping shoulder to shoulder with two thousand other pilgrims may seem cause for temptation and raised eyebrows, but never have I seen anything but excellent moral behavior among our pilgrims. Even where there are dating couples, they hardly ever \\\\\\\\\\\\\"pair off\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the group. The whole atmosphere is one of intense commu-nal living. People are attentive to the needs of everyone, sharing and caring for one another. The pilgrim learns that one does not need to pursue or engage in roman-tic relationships to be happy. Celibacy for the kingdom becomes tangible, livable, and enjoyable. At WYD the intense communal activities, which sometimes involve distressing conditions and both-ersome inconveniences that must be endured, build a joyful esprit de corps. Over and over one witnesses pilgrims making sacrifices for the sake of the group. Opportunities for minor sacrifices abound, such as shar-ing personal items to assist another in need and collect-ing meal tickets and standing in line to retrieve meals for a group. These and other sacrifices reveal acom- Review for Religious mon care for one another. Moreover, the group lead-ers have the ultimate say in all major decisions about travel, gatherings, agendas, and special needs that arise. Individual wills give way to the group, or to the lead-ers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions. Through these experiences one finds joy in sacrificing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own will for the good of the group, opening up to the gift of religious obedience. Consecrated persons make a sacrifice of their lives for the good of the church and the world. Pilgrims experience the power of loving sacrifice firsthand, and its power to build up the Body of Christ. Eddie Dwyer, a Saginaw seminarian, said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Three things I hate are lines, sitting on the floor, and crowded spaces, but the love at WYD made sacrifice easy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" All these experiences find rich meaning in the cel-ebration of the sacraments, namely, confession and Eucharist. The intensity of confessions, celebrations of Holy Mass, and Eucharistic adoration affirms God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real presence among his people. All the sufferings and joys of pilgrimage are offered up to the Father in the won-derful exchange of gifts that the Eucharist makes real. All is gift. As a priest I am overwhelmed by the power and joy of the priesthood, by the sacramental fruitful-ness on WYD. What power can be manifested in such weakness! The Papal Mass at the conclusion of WYD provides the perfect environment for the overflowing gratitude of the pilgrimage to express itself. Pilgrims, freshly and deeply aware of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goodness, gratefully share their belongings with others. Jackets, caps, and an assortment of other personal items are offered and received in a wonderful exchange of gifts. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kingdom becomes visible in everyone giving their things away to bring joy to both receiver and giver. In his Spiritual Exercises 409 68.4 2009 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf Worm Youth Day and Religious Life St. Ignatius Loyola speaks of the free exchange of gifts between those who love each other (\\xc2\\xa7231). This is the Christian life. As church and bride of Christ, we receive every good thing from God and make an offering of our very selves back to him in gratitude. This joyous exchange finds particular power at the Papal Mass. The accumulation and possession of .things no longer has appeal. The giving and receiving of love becomes the reason for existing. Consecrated life witnesses to the joy of the kingdom of heaven through the. gift of self to God. The Papal Mass provides a taste of the joy offered to those who radically take up the call to follow Christ the Bridegroom wherever he goes. As I lead pilgrims to WYD, I make a point of having several priests, seminarians, and religious sisters accom-pany us. When lay pilgrims rub shoulders with conse-crated persons, consecrated life now has a face, and that face is familiar and human. No longer is the question of consecrated life somewhere off in the distance, but it is real and lived by real people. The possibility of consecrated vocation opens up as the joys of serving the kingdom find witness. I count WYD the single most important vocation promotion ministry that I do. 410 Review for Religious BENNY PHANG Marriage and Celibacy: Rivals or Complements? MMarriage and celibacy are often seen as contraries. isunderstanding about these two vocations still exists among many people who do not fully under-stand celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven or the meaning of marriage. They see marriage as con-trary to celibacy, totally separated from it, and unable to contribute anything to it. And they understand celibacy as merely a pessimistic, negative rejection of married life and love. They even think celibacy is responsible for many sexual problems. About these matters people raise critical questions such as: Is marriage contrary to celibacy or even a rival? Is marriage a higher and better state than celibacy, or is it the other way around? Does marriage confirm celibacy or devalue it? If marriage confirms celibacy, how does it do so?

Blog: theouiosoter.blogspot.com 411 68.4 2009 Pbang \\xc2\\xaf Marriage and Celibacy On this topic I want to draw some reflections from the messages of Pope John Paul II (collected in Theology of the Body), from the critical reflection on celibacy in the Catholic Church written by Aloysius Pieris sJ, and from the experience of St. Th~r~se of Lisieux of her vocation to religious life. Marriage and celibacy, are interrelated. To hurt either one by being unfaithful in it also hurts the other. 412- Rival Vocations? In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus places the counsel of celibacy in the discussion of the impor-tance of marriage, when he argues against divorce (Mt 19:3-12). Pope John Paul confirms this, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"[From Matthew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, Mt 19:10-12], it can be seen sufficiently clearly that here it is not a question of diminishing the value of matrimony in favor of continence, nor of less-ening the value of one in comparison with the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words on this point are quite clear. He proposes to his disciples the ideal of continence and the call to it, not by reason of the inferiority of, or of prejudice against, conjugal union in the body, but only for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x992 One can, however, argue for St. Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position when he writes, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"So then, he who marries his fiancee does well\\\\\", \\\\\"and he who refrains from marriage will do better\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Co 7:38). Does this Pauline text not mean that mat-rimony is good, but celibacy for the kingdom of heaven is better?3 Review for Religious We need to comprehend the reason for celibacy in the evangelical counsel. Jesus says, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Mt 19:12). This is the only reason for the evangelical counsel of celibacy. The reason is not to devalue marriage, but for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. To understand the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"difference\\\\\\\\\\\\\" between Jesus and Paul as regards celibacy and marriage, John Paul gives us an insight: In his pronouncement, did Christ perhaps suggest the superiority of continence for the kingdom of heaven to matrimony? Certainly he said that this is an excep-tional vocation, not a common one. In addition he affirmed that it is especially important and necessary to the kingdom of heaven. If we understand superiority to matrimony in this sense, we must admit that Christ set it out implicitly. However, he did not express it direcdy. Only Paul will say of those who choose matri-mony that they do \\\\\\\\\\\\\"well.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" About those who are willing to live in voluntary continence, he will say that they do \\\\\\\\\\\\\"better\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (! Co 7:38). (Theology, p. 275) The conscious and voluntary renunciation of the conjugal love of marriage and family life by celibate per-sons is not a devaluation of marriage, but it is a form of self-sacrifice.

As I come to write these reflections in our final issue of the year 2009, I share various reac-tions that have been part of the landscape over the past months. My first response to the doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prognosis ff)r pancreatic cancer was that it is a gift to be told that one has so many months to live and that an end is in sight. The doctor, of course, went on to give options. I could have an operation, and it would likely add some months. I could also have the operation, followed by chemotherapy/radia-tion, and it would add some months and likely some years. The doctor wanted to give me some time to think about the options, but I immedi-ately agreed with his own stated preference that I would undergo the operation and follow up chemotherapy. It seemed that medically I was in a place where I should follow the biblical injunc-tion, \\\\\"choose life.\\\\\" The operation seemed to be successful in removing the visible cancer, and the six-month- long chemotherapy treatment has been an experimental study program including a vaccine that eliminates radiation. I have fin-ished the program as of the publication of this issue. Now I live within a wait-and-see time of measurement and ~esting. Revie~v for Religious November remains a church time to remember the dead and remind ourselves of our own mortality. I have been feeling even more attuned to the reality of my own personal dying throughout these past months so that it is easy to celebrate November liturgy. It is nice to be put \\\\\"on notice\\\\\"--which is how I consider the identi-fication of my cancer. The likelihood of dying is just made more real and, as it were, within reach. It allows me time to reflect and pray how I face this kind of time, what attitude I want to take, and how I want to use the time I have. It does not seem fearsome or dark. In fact, it seems full of surprises of how God wants to meet me in unexpected ways, sometimes not initially pleasing to me. I seem to be taught a lot about powerlessness, patience, and the goodness of strangers. I also believe strongly in the efficaciousness of the prayer support of others. Advent is a church time of looking forward to new life and especially of our life forever with God. It con-eludes with Christmas, a celebration of how God, in Christ, enters into our human life, never to let it go. Throughout 2009 with all its medical focus, I have con-tinued to be blessed with finding new life and I again look forward to entering into Advent with greater \\xc2\\xaf appreciation. Christmas will be God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own gift to me of celebrating the gift of human life for however many more months and years God intends. With celebrating Christmas, it is good to remember that we were all born to be living a life forever with God, and that remains my hope too. David L.

He has been called the greatest Catholic theologian of the 20th century. He is the inspiration behind many believers who understand themselves as \\\\\"orthodox\\\\\" or \\\\\"solid\\\\\" Catholics. His work has been seen as an example of greater integration of spirituality and theology. He is the author to whom Jon Sobrino SJ refers in his reflec-tions on the \\\\\"faith of Christ,\\\\\" a controver-sial position which has been criticized by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

My plan here is not to analyze all these currents. Rather, I intend to look at Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinctive ideas about the aesthetic-dramatic constitution of Christian reality. He sees God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-disclosure, as occurring first in aesthetic and dramatic forms, and he sees Christians as called to be co-actors in this \\\\\"theo-drama\\\\\" through liturgical ritual and a distinctive way of living. A Generational Concern Some of my attraction to Balthasar is probably gen-erational. I was born ten years after the Second Vatican Council. Although my childhood was shaped by a won-derful Catholic parish and school, my contemporaries and I still experienced what William Portier has called \\\\\"the dissolution of the American Catholic subcul-ture.\\\\\" Not that I particularly desire a restoration of the good old days\",\"for many, those days were apparently not so good. But it seemed to me, as I began to read Balthasar, that he was not only restoring something of the Christian vision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rich particularity and oddness, but also pointing out to people how beautifully and dra-matically that vision has enhanced all kinds of human lives, the great variety of saints most eminently. As he writes in Love Alone Is Credible, \\\\\"Lovers are the ones who know most about God\",\"the theologian must listen to them\\\\\" (p. 12). It was exciting to discover a thinker who brought into his theology the witness of holy people and great texts not normally found in systematic theologians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reflection: Th~r~se of Lisieux, John.of the Cross, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Dante, to name just a few. 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Cbristian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance Balthasar preserved what he called a \\\\\"kneeling theology,\\\\\" without downplaying the use of reason in Christian life. And yet this same thinker also engaged seriously the thought of Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. In other words--Rodney Howsare has shown this in his book Baltbasar and Protestantism: The Ecumenical Implications of His Theological Style--Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theological vision had room both for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation in Christ and for the works of reli-gious- philosophical scholars as legitimate moments in under-standing and present-ing Christian truth. Balthasar preserved what he called a \\\\\"kneeling theology,\\\\\" without downplaying the use of reason in Christian life. His enviable dis-play of both loving devotion and a critical engagement with modernity prompts me to see him as embodying in important ways the dual task of ressourcement and aggior-namento set by Vatican II. Christian Existence as Theo-Drama The aesthetic-dramatic nature of Christian life is shown in the Scriptures. Moses and Paul experienced, aesthetically, the beauty or glory of God in the burn-ing bush and on the road to Damascus. These aesthetic encounters were also dramatic, and they led to the rest of their lives\\xe2\\x80\\x99 being high drama as well. It is a com-mon feature of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures that experiences of God are not just holy feelings\",\"they have a vocational, missionary purpose. The first part of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s multivolume trilogy, The Glory of the Lord, describes the way we first encounter the phenomenon Review for Religious of divine revelation as beautiful. The second part of the trilogy, Theo-Drama, recognizes that God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation is not something we merely look at\",\"rather, we are drawn into the drama of revelation and are called to respond. Robert Barron nicely captures Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dra-matic emphasis: Christianity--like painting, baseball, and philoso-phy- is a world, a form of life. And, like those other worlds, it is first approached because it is perceived as beautiful. A youngster walks onto a baseball dia-mond because he finds the game splendid, and a young artist begins to draw because she finds the artistic universe enchanting. Once the beauty of Christianity has seized a devotee, she will long to submit herself to it, entering into its rhythms, its institutions, its history, its drama, its visions and activities. And then, having practiced it, having worked it into her soul and flesh, she will know it. The movement, in short, is from the beautiful (it is splendid!) to the good (I must play it!) to the true (it is right). In my own encounter with Balthasar, I have most appreciated his dramatic emphasis. In the first volume of his breathtaking five-volume Theo-Drama, Balthasar gives attention to the drama of human existence by using writers like Shakespeare, George Bernanos, Bertolt Brecht, Eugene Ionesco, and even the American Arthur Miller in a kind of prolegomenon to his understanding of Christian existence as \\\\\"theodramatic.\\\\\" His range of reference to Christian, non-Christian, and even anti- Christian dramatists is astonishing. He uses the theater to illuminate the risk and gravity of human life, the catastrophes and tensions that constitute our existence, and the finite time span within which we must struggle for the good, under judgment and in the face of death. The theater can offer an opening to people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encoun- 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Theology\\xe2\\x80\\x99$ Relevance 346 ter with revelation. Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theodramatic approach employs the metaphor of the world stage. As actors in history, human beings share in the Son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mission, under the Holy Spirit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction. Just as an actor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in a theatrical drama constitutes a limited part of the play for a particular purpose, the finite lives of persons who share in the mission of Christ, no matter their life span, dis-close meaning that is relevant for the whole of history. On a personal note, I have appreciated Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dramatic treatment of the tragic in human existence. I have made my own the following remark of Rowan Williams: \\\\\"What I found in Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work was an extraordinary depth of contemplative understand-ing, along with vivid awareness of the tragic quality of human existence--the hellishness of humanity and God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in it--which resonated very deeply with me.\\\\\" Ever since I was a child, I have been par-ticularly sensitive to this tragic dimension, a disposition that has been heightened by my wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily work with children who suffer from cancer. The problem of evil as it manifests itself in sickness, natural disasters, random acts of violence, war, oppression, and genocide is never far from my mind. The late British theologian Donald MacKinnon, noting that Balthasar rarely treats the horror of the Holocaust directly, adds that \\\\\"the nervous ten~ion of the whole argument witnesses to the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion-ate concern to present the engagement of God with his world in a way that refuses to turn aside from the over-whelming, pervasive reality of evil.\\\\\" Balthasar does not paper over the pathos of the real world, a pathos full of darkness and ambiguity. For him, God, in the incarna-tion and passion of Jesus, \\\\\"steps to his opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side and, from within, helps him reach justice and freedom. Review for Religious Hnitude, time, and death are not negated: they are given a new value in a way that is beyond our comprehension. Indeed, even what is hostile to God, in all its profound abysses, is not abandoned\",\"God does not turn his back on it: it is taken over and reworked.\\\\\" Balthasar never taught academic theology at a uni-versity. He spent many years, however, as a university chaplain. In the Switzerland of the 1940s this kind of work was largely cultural. Balthasar the chaplain spent his time giving lectures, in the evening debating in various student societies, and giving retreats. To borrow John W. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Malley SJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s useful catego-ries from his Four Cultures of the West, Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought more resembles cultures three and four--\\\\\"Poetry, Rhetoric, and the Common Good\\\\\" and \\\\\"Art and Performance\\\\\"-- than it does culture two--\\\\\"The Academy and the Professions.\\\\\" O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Malley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks on Erasmus could be said about Balthasar: \\\\\"He felt he could criticize Scholastic theology because he had an alternative to offer: a return to the more literary and rhetorical style of the Fathers. That was the \\xe2\\x80\\x99ancient and genuine\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the-ology, quite different from the \\xe2\\x80\\x99modern\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theology. It was genuine because it was drawn directly from the sacred texts and because it had led to a \\xe2\\x80\\x99theological life.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It touched the heart and centered on the few truths that were essential to Christianity rather than on the second-ary issues the Scholastics pursued\\\\\" (p. 160). Balthasar once remarked that his study with the Jesuits, largely in Neo-Scholastic mode, was a \\\\\"grim struggle with what men had made out of the glory of revelation.\\\\\" He Balthasar never taught academic theology ,at a university. 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance 348 ~ \\\\\"could not endure this presentation of the Word of God and wanted to lash out with the fury of Samson,\\\\\" tear \\\\\"down the whole temple,\\\\\" and bury himself \\\\\"beneath the rubble.\\\\\" It is often true that Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mode of presentation resembles a patristic sermon more than a scholastic treatise. In my recent experiences of presenting papers, giv-ing academic lectures, and doing job interviews, it has become evident that this aesthetic-dramatic emphasis genuinely excites scholars and ordinary laypeople. This emphasis could also be said to be Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest shortcoming as a \\\\\"systematic\\\\\" theologian. He is called \\\\\"unsystematic\\\\\" by those who argue for the indispens-ability of a more scientifically or theoretically con-structed theology in the manner of Thomas Aquinas. Let me address both sentiments. On the one hand, I am convinced that Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dramatic emphasis nurtures an appreciation for the inexhaustible mystery that resides at the heart of Christian revelation. He offers a richly symbolic and imaginative approach--one that fosters better Christian living, namely, the dramatic artistry needed for fulfill-ing our own unique missions. That is, his theology can give momentum to the religious feelings and beliefs that help us accomplish good in the particular circumstances of our lives. On the other hand, the aesthetic-dramatic emphasis is not always helpful when one does \\\\\"system-atic theology\\\\\" in order to answer the further questions that arise out of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aesthetic-dramatic, liturgical, or devotional life. Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology, besides being eclectic, has a contemplative emphasis that prefers to let \\\\\"paradox\\\\\" be the answer, rather than carefully working out a set of terms and relations and bringing a theo-logical intelligibility to the concrete conditions in which Review for Religious Christians live their lives. One is more likely to find this kind of intelligibility in Bernard Lonergan or Karl Rahner. Let me offer an example. It was my encounter with the writings of Balthasar that helped me discover the \\\\\"weightiness\\\\\" of the mystery of the cross. Balthasar is not content with presenting the cross as merely a consequence of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prophetic stance in the world. It is that, but it is also much more. It contains a vicarious element, which somehow involves Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\\\\"taking on\\\\\" the sin of the human race. Balthasar desires to do justice to a dominant theme in the Fathers, namely, the admirabile commercium, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\"wondrous exchange,\\\\\" with sinners. With aesthetic and dramatic power, Balthasar communi-cated to me the cross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power and centrality. And yet as questions arose--How did Jesus \\\\\"take on\\\\\" sin? Did he also take on our guilt? If so, did he also experience a loss of hope and the kind of darkness sinners experience?-- I became less satisfied with his systematic answers (or lack thereof). In my own research I have been more satisfied with a Thomist pattern of explanation (also not without its critics), given contemporary expression in Bernard Lonergan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writings on \\\\\"Satisfaction\\\\\" and the \\\\\"Law of the Cross.\\\\\" Such writings offer terms and relations that can be used in engaging the modern sciences construc-tively. Balthasar has often prompted in me an excite-ment and concern about such theological questions Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology, has a contemplative emphasis that prefers to let \\xe2\\x80\\x99,paradox\\\\\" be the answer. 349 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance and then failed to give me adequate answers. In his De Verbo Incarnato, Lonergan writes that, if one approaches Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death with primarily a \\\\\"symbolic mentality,\\\\\" where image and feeling predominate, then one is likely to express the meaning of the cross in terms of \\\\\"substitution\\\\\" or \\\\\"satispassion,\\\\\" that is, in terms of Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\\\\"suffering enough\\\\\" for sins. These words do not do justice to the sophistication of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach, but they indicate something about his theological style in general and his theology of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death in particular. In my estimation, because of its dramatic terminology and its reliance on the mystical experiences of Adrienne von Speyr, Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theology of Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passion and death is often unclear and even reckless. I wonder, though, whether this theological question, sparked by the power of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation, would have occurred to me at all without his help. Balthasar himself was not concerned with meeting the requirements of a technical, theoretical, systematic theologian. He once said in an interview, \\\\\"My books are not the kind of theology that belongs to the aca-demic guild and therefore they are not particularly suited for dissertations.\\\\\" He remarked, \\\\\"I have to say that for me the only truly interesting theologians are the saints: from. Irenaeus through Augustine to Anselm, to Bonaventure, or figures that allow the radiation of holiness to show forth, such as Dante or Newman\",\"one could also mention Kierkegaard and Solovyov.\\\\\" A Call for Fruitful Integration My concern goes beyond the question of Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adequacy as a systematic theologian. I have accentuated his aesthetic-dramatic approach here, but I know there are many other approaches as well. My concern is the Review for Religious shape of Catholic theology in the 21st century and the place of the aesthetic-dramatic style therein. Vv\\xe2\\x80\\x99hat does theology conceived in Anselmian fashion as \\\\\"faith seek-ing understanding\\\\\" mean in light of the many theologi-cal styles we have inherited from the 20th century, from what Fergus Kerr has called \\\\\"the Heroic Generation\\\\\"? In my discussion of the cross, I have offered a \\\\\"the-oretical\\\\\" or \\\\\"explanatory\\\\\" challenge to Balthasar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theological style. Let me now say that Balthasar, too, offers a challenge. He makes us ask: Must not theol-ogy go well :beyond understanding to an understand-ing that is aesthetically and dramatically in touch with the joys and challenges of ordinary Christian existence? Shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t theology be more attentive to the Mystery that is encountered in aesthetic and dramatic form in our workaday world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer and worship? A question remains regarding what to do with the diversity of theological styles we have inherited. R.R. Reno has suggested that \\\\\"we need a period of consolidation that allows us to integrate the lasting achievements of the Heroic Generation into a renewed standard theology.\\\\\" Let me suggest, without adequate exposition, one possible way forward, a way which has been similarly outlined by Robert Doran SJ. The chal-lenge of this generation is to integrate three 20th-cen-tury theological movements--contemporary Thomism, the ressourcement project of la nouvelle thdologie, and the various expressions of political-liberation theol-ogy. These three movements could be of help (1) in explaining theological doctrines in a theoretical man-ner that is capable of engaging with the natural and social sciences in search of a unity of knowledge\",\"(2) in experiencing and mediating Catholic thought and culture through aesthetic-dramatic forms\",\"and (3) in 68.4 2009 Rosenberg * Christian Existence and Tbeology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Relevance dealing with concrete human suffering of all kinds in light of the gospel mandate to transform a world in need. Such a grand vision would require sympathetic and critical conversations, the highlighting of comple-mentarities and dialectical differences, and the humil-ity to be open to revision. If such an integration were to occur, it would require doing justice in an orderly way to the richness of being human in the flow of his-tory, that is, being psychological, intellectuall rational, moral, loving, mystical, and worshipful. For this enter-prise Balthasar would certainly not have all the answers, but he would have much to contribute to it.

Perception of such impalpable reality may take no time or consume no little time. Communicating that reality, however, normally requires time, and maybe a detour. Anyway, in the present case, the process has been for me an experience of obscurum per obscurius, though at the end it was all darum (clear), bathed in light. \\\\\"Hindu Prayer: A First for Congress\\\\\"--that was the title of the news item from India Abroad News Service on 14 September 2000. The news was the historic event of a Hindu priest delivering the opening prayer in the United States House of Representatives.1 The prayer ran as follows: \\\\\"O God, you are omnipresent, omnipo-tent, and omniscient. You are everything, and nothing A. Paul Dominic SJ wrote for us about dreams in 2008. His address is Aishalton c/o St Ignatius Mission\",\"Lethem P.O.\",\"Rupununi, Guyana (South America). Emaih pauldominicsj@yahoo.com 68.4 2009 Dominic \\xc2\\xaf How You Eat Matters is beyond you. You are our mother and father, and we are all your children.\\\\\" It continued: \\\\\"Whatever you do is for our good. You are the ocean of mercy, and you forgive our errors. You are our teacher, and you guide us on to righteousness .... Today, in this great hall, are assembled the elected representatives of the people of this nation. They are ready to perform their duties. God, please guide them in their thoughts and actions so they can achieve\\xe2\\x80\\x99the greatest good for all.\\\\\" The prayer ended with an invocation from the ancient scriptures of India. \\\\\"May all be happy, may all be free from disease, may all realize what is good, may none be subject to misery\",\"peace, peace, peace be unto all.\\\\\" The fact of the Hindu prayer in the U.S. Congress was objectionable and even threatening to some. Many others strongly counterprotested. Anyway, the words of the prayer cannot be construed really offensive to any-one, except of course an atheist. As a matter of fact, they breathe the deepest longings of harried humanity hop-ing in the Divinity. The way they are addressed to God smacks of no narrow Hinduism nor any sectarianism for that matter, but an inclusive theism. The God invoked is everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s God.2 If the Hindu priest had his own traditional or peculiar thoughts about God, in no way does that show itself in his prayer. Even the concluding prayer, taken from the Hindu scriptures, sounds indeed more universal than particularly Hindu. It seems to show that genuine prayer cuts across ,barriers of religion. Everything connected with prayer in Hinduism can-not, of course, be explained thus. There are aspects of Hindu worship that are confined and meaningful only to adherents of Hinduism with its practices and tenets. Even here, however, it is wise to distinguish between what is exclusively Hindu and what is purely religious-- Review for Religious even though in practice the two are generally too inter-twined to detect. We should, however, exercise ourselves in this regard, for we can be surprisingly enriched as Christians and, what is more, find ourselves agree-ably bonded with other sincere believers. For example, though the ritual of sacrifice in various religions is dif-ferent in all of them and likely to distract and distance other people, the faith element in those sacrifices can be heartwarming and edifying to all those who can intuit it. Some reading I did about Hindu sacrifice proved to be quite inspiring. From it I got a sense of the homely and heavenly meaning of sacrifice beyond the altar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s formal vesture, furnishings, and ceremony. I have grown to believe that eating at table has the character and odor of a true sacrifice. I was confirmed in my belief when I found a simi-lar thought in a poet with a Christian background. He shares his vision charmingly and persuasively: Since you must kill to eat, and rob the newly born of its mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship, And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacri-ficed for that which is purer and still more innocent in man.3 I have no inkling of how the poet arrived at his vision of profound truth. I can recount, however, my experience in this regard, recalling first the Hindu insight. i have grown to believe that eating at table has the character and odor of a true sacrifice. 68.4 2009 Dominic * How You Eat Matters A Hindu Adumbration The universe in the ancient Hindu vision originat-ing from the Vedic4 times of 2000 BC consisted of three worlds: the physical, the psychological, and the spiritual manitCesting themselves not as separate but congruent spheres. Fire (Affni in Sanskrit) at the physical level was obviously visible flames, like those burning a sacrificial offering to the deity. At the psychological level it was the mind exercising itself in thinking and knowing. At the spiritual level the same word was a name of God. Given the superiority of the spiritual over the physical and the psychological, the latter two were regarded and grasped as manifestations of the one supreme Spirit called Agrni, extending through the three-tiered universe. \\\\\"The fire which is the sun, the fire which is the earth, that fire is in my own heart,\\\\\" as a Vedic verse put it pithily. One cannot miss the images of the three worlds: the sun standing for the spiritual, the earth for the material, and the human for the psychological.5 Anyone who is not at ease with this ancient under-standing needs only a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought to see its con-nection with reality. For this a comparison with another religious tradition may help. In the Judaic tradition, physical fire serves the cultic needs of purification and liturgical rituals of offering. Fire that necessarily burns can signi~ blazing anger and, more importantly, the tribulation that cleanses the heart and proves the soul righteous. Fire is predicated of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own self in theophanies of saving presence, transcendence, and benevolence. God appears as the burning bush and the pillar of fire and indeed as consuming fire (Dt 4:24, 9:3\",\"Is 33:14). God purifies his servants and sets them afire with zeal so that the whole universe may shine in glory. Christian tradition has inherited this entire view Review for Religious and given it its own emphasis. Recall Jesus saying: \\\\\"I have come to bring fire on the earth and desire that it be kindled\\\\\" (Lk 12:49).6 Observing parallels in the Vedic and Biblical views of the world, one may see other ones as well. In the Vedic thought, sacrifice involves a conscious perception that the three worlds are bound together as one universe. Sacrifice involves lighting a fire and burning an obla-tion on the altar. The idea behind the ritual is that the spiritual fire that is in heaven is also buried in the earth, and so it bursts forth when stones or sticks are struck. By being burned, the gifts laid on the altar are carried to heaven. The fiery sacrifice returns all that is on the earth to its original source in heaven. The ideal of sacrifice behind this graphic picture is not absent in the Bible. Elijah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successful sacrifice when the prophets of Baal miserably failed (1 K 18:22.-38) comes to mind here. To continue still further with the inner significance of the Vedic sacrifice, as long as sacrifice is performed everything keeps returning to its origin, and human beings find themselves living in harmony with the uni-verse. When people fail in their duty of sacrifice, they interfere with the cyclic rhythm that sustains the world of which they are a part. They use the mountain of gifts without attending to their nature, thereby isolating both themselves and all things from their origin. They violate the law of the universe. But, when sacrifice is duly and gratefully done, it redounds to universal prosperity. This seems reflected in Psalm 50: \\\\\"Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and pay your vows to the Most High.\\\\\" The last element of all sacrifice is perhaps too obvi-ous to be striking: it is eating the sacrificial offerings. What is offered in sacrifice is normally things that peo-ple eat, and so a sacrifice ends as a sacrificial meal. But 68.4 2009 Dominic \\xc2\\xaf How You Eat Matters In the matter of sacrifice, the universal beliefwas that, when humans ate something of the sacrifice, the deity had partaken of it first. who eats in sacrifice? Those who sacrifice, of course. But, as the sacrifice is not offered to themselves, they do not eat alone. When the sacrifice is consumed by fire, it is believed that the deity above consumes it. This understanding is highlighted in the Hindu scriptural verse: \\\\\"I, the Lord, become the fire of life, and seated in the body I consume the four kinds of food.\\\\\" This passage is certainly obscure for many, though it is for Hindus a familiar verse (vakya in Sanskrit) of the Bhagavad Gita, perhaps the most personal of all their scriptures. Anyway, what it says links human eating with divine eat-ing. In the matter of sacrifice, the universal belief was that, when humans ate something of the sacrifice, the deity had partaken of it first. Similarly, one may well conclude that what humans eat in ordinary meals is at the same rime consumed by \\\\\"the fire of life,\\\\\" which is none other than God dwelling in human bodies. And so a human meal itself becomes a sacrifice to God. Bede Griffiths, the English Benedictine who, along with other foreign pioneers in India, continued the Indian tradition of ashram (akin to monasticism in the Western tradition), explains the point thus: \\\\\"That fire, which is in the heaven above and in the earth beneath, is in our own bodies\",\"we offer our food in sacrifice in that inner fire and it is consumed in the fire and surrendered to God again. So a meal is a sacrifice.\\\\\" Here is a subtle move from a sacrificial meal eaten on occasion to daily Review for Religious meals eaten in the joyous, harmonious spirit of sacri-fice. Drawing from another stanza in the Bhagavad Gita, Griffiths concludes that \\\\\"anyone taking a meal without sacrificing is a thief\",\"this is to take the gifts of God and appropriate them to oneself instead of receiving them as gifts and returning thanks.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x997 A Christian Follow-Up Such a thought can startle nominal or profane Christians who have no thought of God whatever when they satisfy their hunger and thirst or overly indulge their tastes. Normal devout Christians accustomed to their routine mealtime prayer may well find more mean-ing in their daily practice. The grace before and after meals will then become the grace of meals as sacrifice. The whole meal from start to finish becomes an exercise and experience of grace, with the grace understood in terms of sacrifice. If sacrifice involves material fire for burning the oblation, daily meals as sacrifice ought to burn with the psychospiritual fire of desire--desire not merely for food, but for the One who gives the food. The Giver of food gives not only the natural and won-derful food and drink, but also the hunger, thirst, and taste buds necessary to enjoy it. Further, through our gratefulness God raises our minds beyond the mean philosophy of eat, drink, and be merry before it is too late. Enkindled by this grate-fulness, we cannot but experience a burning hunger for God. This does not produce asceticism in us so much as refine our taste for the simple, healthy, necessary food that makes for joyous living. At the same time it enables us to find God in food itself.8 This way of eating, that is much more than munching and gulping, becomes a sacrifice by virtue of the prayer surrounding our meals. 68.4 2009 Dominic \\xc2\\xaf How You Eat Matters As St. Paul says, food is for the stomach and the stom-ach for food, and ultimately the body is for the Lord (1 Co 6:13). Sacrificial prayer, then, from hearts burn-ing with fervor for God, rises like incense and raises people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirits while leaving them contented with their daily bread. It is the very opposite of making a god of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s belly (Ph 3:19)9 and sacrificing to it. This talk is not farfetched or feverishly imagined. It breathes the spirit of Jesus who, being more a mystic than an ascetic, ate with much gratitude to his Abba God and with the childlike merriment of having been blessed. When necessary he gave hungry people food, but he also chided them for not understanding their hunger aright. One may learn a lot from his controversy with them as they were looking for him the day after he had miraculously fed them with bread and fish to their hearts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 content (Jn 6). He unveiled to them their own undignified thoughts regarding food and satisfaction. He warned them not to work for food that cannot give life, but for the food from God that gives eternal life. \\\\\"God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bread comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\\\\\" Jesus told them that people do not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth (Mr 4:4). Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conduct in eating teaches about meal as sac-rifice. He takes the bread, looks up to heaven where his Abba Father dwells, gives thanks to him, and shares the bread with those around him generously, then pre-sumably eats along with them till finally making sure that nothing that remains goes to waste (Mt 14:19-20). While this pictures partly the proper Jewish uttering of a blessing such as \\\\\"Praised be thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from earth,\\\\\" Jesus portrays more faithfully and characteristi- Review for Religious cally what his Abba intended when he led his people, feeding them with manna and so training them for life. His counsel to his eager listeners on the Mount is not to worry about food and drink. His words are meant to uplift them with the realization of their blessings on any given day, making of it a sacrifice of praise and grati-tude. The same spirit suffuses the prayer Jesus taught people to pray: \\\\\"Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread\\\\\" (Lk 11:2-3). Because our daily meals are ideally sacrifices filling us with gratitude and.uniting us with the bountiful Abba Father, Jesus began his unique sacrifice at an ordinary, if festive, meal, his last meal before he died. And there he bequeathed his new sacrifice in the form of a unique meal. It is with the same inspiration that he spoke of the heavenly life with God as a banquet of communion with God and all God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beloved (Mt 8:11, 22:2). What happens when, thinking of a penitential aspect of sacrifice, we lose sight of the sublime aspect of eat-ing and drinking? One answer is that then we cannot fully engage in the divine mystery of our Christian sac-rifice. We would even act contrary to the spirit of the sacrifice when we are not celebrating the Liturgy for-mally. The Corinthians did this, as Paul reminded them. When they came together for the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper, they did not wait for the Lord. Paul says: \\\\\"When you meet together, it is not the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk\\\\\" (1 Co 11:20-21). To spell out an implication in Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, ordinary human meals should be much like the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supper. There is or should be etiquette and the spirit of sacrifice in every ordinary meal. 361 68.4 2009 Dominic * How You Eat Matters 362 The Hindu version of what happens when we do not honor the sacrificial aspect of human eating is best illustrated by a Hindu story. A man sought to know from a Hindu priest the greatest being in the universe worthy of a sacrifice. Following the clear instruction, he began offering food to the newly acquired idol in his house. One day he found a rat eating the offering. Inferring that the rat must be greater than the idol, he began making his sacrificial offering to the rat, till one day he saw a cat threatening the rat. So he began mak-ing his sacrifice to the cat. One day the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife saw the cat on an eating spree in the kitchen and chased it away with a stick2 Made aware of this greater power of his wife, he began making his sacrifice to her. Then one day, finding the meal she cooked and served too salty, he shouted at her. She quivered at his anger. That encounter made him feel superior to his wife, and so he began to offer food sacrificially to himself. He ate and ate until he died. Can anyone be so foolish? Not in such an obvious way, but most of us are probably about half that foolish. The really wise, of course, would know how to enjoy food and drink while recognizing that they are also part of the grateful sacrifice due to God. There is something beautiful and divine in such sacrifice pervading daily life without formal rubrics and yet illumining the rubrics of the altar. \\\\\"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God\\\\\" (1 Co 10:31).

WITTBERG religious life models Opening a New Window: Fifteen Years after the FORUS Study More than fifteen years ago, Miriam Ukeritis csJ and David Nygren CM published their groundbreaking study, The Future of Religious Orders in the United States) In it they predicted that religious congregations had only a ten-year window of opportunity before the aging of their current members and the lack of new entrants would render them nonviable. Many resisted this prediction, refusing to believe it. Some spun visions of an alternate (and socio-logically naive) future in which religious con-gregations would expand to include married and single, vowed and nonvowed, Catholic and non-Catholic, male and female, all somehow gathered together under the aegis of a vaguely defined charism? Others, not knowing what to believe, considered religious life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future Patricia A. Wittberg SC wrote about the \\\\\"recipro-cal identities\\\\\" of apostolic life and consecrated life in our July-August 2002 issue. Her address remains 2141 Dugan Drive\",\"Indianapolis, Indiana 46260. Email: pwittber@iupui.edu Review for Religious something they could do litde about and focused their diminishing energies on their ministries instead. Fifteen years later, for many religious congregations, the window of opportunity appears to have closed. Few if any of their members are under the age of sixty\",\"no one has entered for ten or even twenty years\",\"vocation directors are burned out or depressed. Many members coverdy believe--and some openly argue--that it is use-less and unethical to invite young people to enter. It is for these congregations, especially, that I am writing this article, but I offer it as well to communities which are in less dire straits. I. believe that both could profit from the following alternative. I would like to point out a different--and more sociologically feasible--path for the future of declining religious congregations. I do not see this as replacing traditional religious life--which is thriving on a smaller scale in some (but not all) of the CMSWR congregations in the United States, and on a larger scale in Africa and South Asia. There will always be a place in the church for the traditional model of religious life. But U.S. Catholic culture is no longer as hospitable to this model as it once was. If it were, several hundred, not a few dozen, traditional religious congregations would be springing up in this country, and they would be doubling in membership every decade. Such explosive growth was the norm for religious congregations founded in the 19th century, and it obviously is not happening today. This comparative lack of interest, however, does not indicate that present-day U.S. Catholics are unspiritual heathens. They simply are not attracted to the traditional model. I believe that American Catholicism would be bet-ter served if several other versions of religious life were also available to young Catholics. By\\\\\"other versions\\\\\" I 68.4 2009 tVittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window A social movement is a wave of beliefs and/or actions that sweeps large numbers of persons into working toward a specific goal. 366 do not mean the lifestyles currendy being modeled by most of the non-CMSWR religious congregations. These are faring even worse than the traditionalist orders in attracting new members. Their charisms are still beau-tiful and, for the most part, still valid in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world. But they are not being presented in a form that appeals to young Catholics today. Instead, I want to suggest a different strategy for handing on a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism to a new generation: starting one---or preferably severalmsocial-movement orga-nizations. To explain how this would work, I first need to define a few terms. Broadly considered, a social movement is a wave of beliefs and/or actions that sweeps large numbers of persons into working toward a specific goal. Examples are the civil-rights movement, the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement, the envi-ronmental movement, and the right-to-life movement. Each of these movements may con-tain dozens of separate social-movement organizations (SMOs) which focus on particular activities, particular groups of people, or particular issues related to the larger movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals. Thus, the environmental movement includes large organiza-tions like the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy, and Greenpeace and also many smaller groups that focus on saving the monarch butterfly, cleaning up a local river, opposing the dumping of toxic waste, and so forth.3 There have been religious social movements and, thus, religious social-movement organizations as well. In Review for Religious Protestantism, a succession of social movements called \\\\\"Great Awakenings\\\\\" sparked a host of religious revival groups throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, several of which developed into full-fledged denominations such as the Mormons, the Seventh-Day Adventists, and the various Pentecostal churches. In Catholicism, waves of devotionalism swept through both 17th-century France and 19th-century North America,4 spinning off pilgrim-age societies, sodalities, and prayer groups devoted to particular saints, scapulars, or novenas. These were not .religious orders at their inception, but some later did develop in that direction. Other times they simply strengthened the existing orders. I am suggesting that religious congregations con-sciously try to foster something similar today. Most still have one or more members who are passionate about meeting some particular need in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world, be it sav-ing the environment, feeding the poor, sheltering home-less women and children, providing free medical care to the uninsured, or mentoring the spiritually searching,s Many of these members have already worked out a more or less specific theology to ground their activities and to explain how their passion fits with the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism. Some have recruited a corps of volunteers to help them in. their work. To paraphrase the famous line from MoliEre,6 they are already \\\\\"forming a religious SMO without knowing it.\\\\\" However, these passionate members are often less connected to the rest of the con-gregation. For years, even decades, the other members may have left them alone to \\\\\"do their own thing.\\\\\" But it is only a small step from what these indi-vidual religious are already instinctively doing, for their congregation deliberately to form and maintain several SMOs to enflesh its charism for subsequent genera- 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window 368 tions. All that remains is to help each incipient group to articulate its identity publicly, to specify clearly its religious grounding in the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism, and to take specific steps to ensure its leadership continuity and stable membership. This might simply involve: \\xc2\\xaf Picking a name connected with both the charism of the congregation and the specific focus of the group: \\\\\"Vincentian Servants of the Homeless,\\\\\" \\\\\"Franciscan Brothers and Sisters of the Earth,\\\\\" \\\\\"Centering Pray-ers,\\\\\" and so forth. \\xc2\\xaf Adopting an identifiable sign of group affiliation, for example, a common T-shirt or a medal. \\xc2\\xaf Maintaining a public-relations effort to inform potential volunteers, donors, other members of the con-gregation, and the church at large about the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence and to attract them to its mission. \\xc2\\xaf Spelling out the criteria for entering and exiting the group, expectations of membership, and ongoing group governance. Previous evidence indicates that, paradoxically, groups with more rigorous expectations are more likely to succeed than those which demand less of their adherents.7 The first two steps are relatively simple, and may already have been taken. But they are not enough. Unless some provision is made for the continuance of the SMO, it may not survive its founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement. The founding brother or sister may be neither inter-ested in nor skilled at such bureaucratic maintenance activities. For the remaining steps, therefore, a religious congregation may be able to offer valuable help from its communications office (for the third task), and its leadership (for the fourth). The kind of social-movement organization I am advocating may or may not be represented by a con- Review for Religious gregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associate program. A congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associ-ates could certainly be this kind of group--but only if they are organized around a readily articulated spiri-tual focus and/or apostolic activity that distinguishes associate membership from the larger call given to any Catholic. Simply stating that associates are devoted to \\\\\"living the charism of the founder\\\\\" is not enough. The more focused the associates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitment--whether in monthly or weekly prayer/lectio according to the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirituality, or in working on a regular basis with the vowed members in their ministry, or in staffing some auxiliary ministry that complements that of the vowed members--the more my SMO proposal here can be applied to them. Otherwise, an associateprogram will not be sufficiendy distinct from the lifestyle of non-associates to enflesh the order\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism on its own. Advantages of the SMO Model I am suggesting that some congregations--especially those whose members have tacitly abandoned the hope of attracting new vowed members--make a point of acknowledging this and then start to recruit people for their present members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 particular SMOs. What would be the advantages of such a strategy? First of all, any given religious congregation will survive only to the extent that its members are passionately devoted to some particular version of their founding charism. The future of religious life does not rest with the tired or apathetic, but after a long period of decline many religious now are both. Most congregations have only a few members with the needed passion and enthusiasm. Moreover, these members may not all be focused on the same passion. Some may live and breathe God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call to serve the poor\",\"others may devote their energies to preserving God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window Any given religious congregation will survive only to the extent that its members are passionately ~devoted to some particular version of their founding charism. 370 creation through environmental activities\",\"still others, with a more contemplative bent, may foster spirituality through centering prayer, pastoral counseling, or reli-gious art or music. A religious order faced with only a handful of healthy and passionate vowed members, each deeply devoted to a different passion, faces a serious dilemma. It can either focus on one of these passions to the exclu-sion of the others (which would be profoundly alien-ating to those left out), or it can try to include all of them (which dilutes the con-gregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spe-cific identity and its ability to rally its members around a common goal). Either way, a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to recruit to vowed membership is weakened if its remaining passion-ate members are devoted to different articulations of its charism, because its overall corporate mission identity will be weak.8 In contrast, enfleshing these articulations in several different SMOs would strengthen a congregation and improve the chances for its charism to survive. Since each SMO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participants are not necessarily vowed to the congregation, it is not only possible but desirable that several could exist under the same congregational \\\\\"rOOfo\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x999 The more different SMOs a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members \\\\\"spin off,\\\\\" the greater the chance that one, at Review for Religious least, will catch fire. As I will argue below, this may then become the seed for the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future. A second advantage of the SMO approach is that it is a sociologically feasible way of incorporating temporary members or inviting specific demographic groups into the congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family. The prospect of temporary membership in permanently vowed religious congrega-tions has been discussed for over thirty years without ever coming to fruition.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xb0 This is probably a sign that the concept is unworkable. A host of decisions would need to be faced in a congregation that included both permanent and temporary members: financial expec-tations, for example, or voice and vote in chapters. Maintaining a distinction between the two groups could imply a second-class status for the temporary members\",\"erasing the distinction would depreciate the perpetually vowed members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitment. Also, there is not now and never has been any indi-cation that large numbers of potential entrants are clamoring for the option of temporary membership in communities with perpetual vows. If anything, the opposite is the case. In contrast, however, various lay movements that are similar to SMOs are thriving in the church--which may be a sign that the model is a more compatible and sociologically viable Way of enfleshing a religious call in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world.\\xe2\\x80\\x991 Lay social-movement organizations are compat-ible with temporary commitment. In fact, many actu-ally expect that their members will stay no more than three or four years. Prayer or volunteer groups specifi-cally targeting high school or college students would be examples of these. A recently begun group is the St. Joseph of Arimathea Society--groups of high school students in Cleveland and Louisville who help provide 371 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window A final advantage of religious \\xc2\\xaf social-movement organizations is that it is less devastating for the members if they dissolve. dignified and reverent funeral services for homeless peo-ple, and for murder victims and deceased old and young people whose relatives are too few or too devastated to arrange a funeral themselves. The students provide sing-ers and pallbearers, tend the \\\\\"potter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s field\\\\\" cemetery, and collect money for flowers and grave markers. More traditional examples of student organiza-tions include prayer groups (Athletes for Christ, rosary or adoration societies) or twinning arrange-ments with a school in a poor area. There is no expectation that the students will remain members of these groups after their graduation, although they may be directed to affiliated adult groups which they may or may not choose to join. A final advantage of religious social-movement orga-nizations is that it is less devastating for the members if they dissolve. While no data exist on the number of failed attempts that preceded or accompanied the suc-cessful founding of religious orders in previous centu-ries, anecdotal evidence in our histories indicates that at least as many attempts to found religious orders have failed as succeeded. This appears to be true today as well. Of the 97 new religious communities listed in the 1999 Directory of Embrging Religious Communities, 24 had dissolved by 2006, and another 21 had lost members.~2 Founding or truly refounding a religious order is a chancy business, and those who commit their lives to one of these new groups risk losing both financial security Review for Religious and mental/emotional health if they fail. Committing oneself to an SMO carries with it many fewer risks. Outcomes For those religious who are concerned for the pres-ervation of their congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism, forming one or more SMOs could have several beneficial results: \\xc2\\xaf Social-movement organizations may be effective recruit-ment vehicles for vowed membership. With few religious teaching in Catholic schools, most young Catholics have never seen a sister or brother. And few religious inter-act with anyone younger than fifty on a deep or regu-lar basis. How can young Catholics join a lifestyle they know so little about? How can religious invite those they never see? Participating with vowed religious on an ongoing basis in a soup kitchen, a prayer group, or an ecological project will help young people get to know the religious involved--and vice versa. \\xc2\\xaf One particular social-movement organization may develop into the vehide that will carry a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charism into the next generation, after all of the former vowed mem-bers are gone. If so, this would finally realize the inclusive \\xc2\\xaf scenario that the \\\\\"Transformative Elements\\\\\" painted for the future of religious life twenty years ago. How could anyone say that a religious charism was extinct if, instead of a small number of vowed religious, an SMO of married, single, Catholic, and non-Catholic men and women were living it out by feeding the hungry, praying a particular devotion, tutoring poor children, or in some other way were bringing the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original vision into the 21st century? \\\\\"Life is not ended, merely changed.\\\\\" \\xc2\\xaf A truly successful social-movement organization will often, however, contain a number of members who do want to devote their entire lives to its vision. It may 373 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window be that these members will not join the original community, but will instead begin a new one. If the first community is still around at this point, their wisdom and experi-ence would be invaluable for the new group. If not, the stories of the SMO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original founder--the sister who started a free clinic in Appalachia, the brother whose soup kitchen mobilized a city to feed the poor--will serve as a template. After all, Frederick Ozanam (the founder of the St. Vincent de Paul Society) lived sev-eral centuries after Vincent himself. St. John Bosco had never met St. Francis de Sales. Throughout the millennium and a half that Catholic religious life has existed, many new religious orders or lay groups have been formed from old templates. SMOs could provide templates of this very kind. Next Steps I believe that social-movement organizations could be useful, both for religious congregations that have given up on recruiting vowed members, and also for more-viable communities that still attract some young people. For the former, it may be the last remaining way they have of passing on their charism to a new genera-tion. For the latter, it may help them attract even more new entrants. The next steps I would suggest to con-gregations wishing to found such organizations--or to foster the ones their individual members have already begun--are as follows: \\xc2\\xaf Take inventory of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society: What are its deep-est needs or desires? As I have noted previously,~3 the best way to determine these needs is to look at what larger social movements are currently growing. The most pressing social movements reveal themselves by the large number of SMOs they spawn. Are there already Review for Religious a lot of small environmental groups? Prayer groups? Adoration groups? Groups working with the poor? Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s groups? Check out the directory of associa-tions on the Internet Public Library (http://www.ipl. org/div/aon/)to find out. Is there room for another SMO, locally, in this movement? For example, is there a group that the movement currently does not reach, such as Hispanics or high school youth? Is there a new tactic or way of addressing the issue that existing SMOs do not use? Could adding your congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirituality or charism deepen commitment to the social movement? \\xc2\\xaf Take inventory of your congregation: Who are your passionate members? What are their passions? How, if at all, do these passions relate to the charism of your founder? What larger social movements do these pas-sions relate to? Are your community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passionate mem-bers interested in leading or organizing a group to assist them in their work? Or, better, have they already done so? Are other members in your congregation interested in helping them? \\xc2\\xaf What does the group still need in order to succeed? Does it need to expand its pool of potential volunteers? Secure more stable funding? Plan for the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement? What is the optimum size for the group? Would expansion be good for it--or dilute its unique character? If the latter, can the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s model be \\\\\"fran-chised\\\\\" in some way, with separate independent chap-ters in various cities?14 \\xc2\\xaf What assistance can the congregation render? Can your communications office help to publicize the group? Can your vocation personnel and/or associates help locate new volunteers? Does the group need a place to meet? Need mentoring in finances or grant writing? What about retreats or prayer days on the charism? And 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New Window 376 who in the congregation could provide these services? A weakness in any new religious organization is its \\\\\"liabil-ity of newness,\\\\\" which may lead to mistakes that imperil its very survival. A more experienced mentor could be a tremendous help. It is obvious by now that religious life is at the end of one of the cyclic downturns which have recurred over the centuries. Rather than resign ourselves to our \\\\\"inev-itable\\\\\" extinction--and thereby create a self-fulfilling prophecy--I think we should notice that the SMO model offers a way to midwife the new forms of religious life that will thrive and grow in the years ahead. The many permutations of this model already appearing--associ-ate programs, lay ecclesial movements, mixed emerg-ing communities--are foreshadowings, I believe, of an absorbing future. This is true even if most of them fail, as new ventures often do. More will continue to spring up until some \\\\\"get it right.\\\\\" With their centuries-long experience and the passions of at least some of their vowed members, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religious congregations could help in this rebirth. Notes ~ David Nygren and Miriam D. Ukeritis, The Future of Religious Orders in the United States: Transformation and Commitment (Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1993). 2 A good example would be the third and fourth of the so-called \\\\\"Transformative Elements\\\\\" developed by the joint CMSM/LCWR meet-ing in Louisville in 1989--and cited on pp. 255 and following of Nygren and Ukeritis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book. Supposedly, this is what religious life would look like in the year 2010. In hindsight, it reflects more wishful thinking than any real-world trends for vowed religious life. 3 Fora fuller discussion of social movements and social-movement organizations, see my Pathways to Re-Creating Religious Communities (Mahwah: Paulist Press, 1996), chap. 4. 4 See Elizabeth Rapley, The D~votes: Women and Church in Seventeenth Review for Religious Century France (Montreal: McGill-Queens University Press, 1990), and Anne Taves, The Household of Faith: Roman Catholic Devotions in Nineteenth Century America (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), for these waves of devotionalism. s My own congregation has individual sisters--of whom I am extremely proud--deeply involved in all of these activities. 6 Or maybe not so famous--the citation refers to a line from Moli~re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comedy Le bourgeois gentilhomme, in which a nouveau riche man is being tutored in literature and discovers that he has been speak-ing prose all of his life without knowing it. 7 See, e.g., Rodney Stark and Roger Finke, Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), chap. 7. 8 According to the Nygren and Ukeritis study, mission identity is the principal variable influencing a congregation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success (see pp. 97-98). 9 Several religious families have known this instinctively. For exam-ple, my own Vincentian tradition includes, not only the Congregation of the Mission, the Daughters of Charity, and the various Sister of Charity Federation congregations, but also the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Ladies of Charity, Vincentian Marian Youth, the Association of the Miraculous Medal, and the Missionary Cenacle, all of which are move-ment organizations of nonvowed laypersons. Similarly the Salesian family includes, not only the Salesian priests and Visitation nuns, but other vowed religious such as the Sisters of Mary Help of Christians, the Missionaries of St. Francis, the Salesian Missionaries of Mary Immaculate, and the Oblate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales, plus lay groups such as the Association of St. Francis de Sales and the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales. to I am not referring here to societies of apostolic life like the Daughters of Charity, who make annual vows, but rather to including an option for temporary membership in congregations whose members are now expected to make perpetual vows. Moreover, even among the Daughters of Charity, there is the assumption that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual vows are really for life. ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99 According to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA), Emerging Communities of Consecrated Life in the United States (Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 2006, p. 16), ten of the twelve most rapidly growing new indigenous emerging communities in the U.S. are mixed communities with some, or all, lay members. t2 CAP, A, Emerging Communities, p. 16. 377 68.4 2009 Wittberg \\xc2\\xaf Opening a New V~ndow ,3 Wittberg, Pathways, pp. 80-85. ,4 The above-mentioned St. Joseph of Arimithea Society seems to operate through \\\\\"franchises\\\\\"--the Cleveland and Louisville chapters appear to be separate from each other.

CLARK Revisiting Religious Identity mnthe years following the Second Vatican Council, uch attention was focused on changes in religious life. Much writing and much effort have been directed toward rethinking or reimaging religious life. In light of all that, one might be tempted to say \\\\\"Enough already!\\\\\" An old saying has it that familiarity breeds contempt. Familiarity can also breed complacency and neglect. It might be good, then, to look once again at what it means to be a religious, to reflect on our religious iden-tity. Besides the decree on the renewal of religious life, Perfectae caritatis, Vatican Council II also spoke of the role of religious in Lumen gentium, the dogmatic con-stitution on the church. In chapter 6, \\xc2\\xa744, we read that the religious state \\\\\"manifests in a special way that the kingdom of God and its high requirements transcend all earthly considerations, bringing home to all people William P. Clark OMI, longtime teacher and administrator, lives at St, Henry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Oblate Residence\",\"200 North 60th Street\",\"Belleville, Illinois 62223. 379 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity the immeasurable greatness of the power of Christ in his sovereignty and the infinite might of the Holy Spirit marvelously working in the church.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\\" The council is simply saying religious life gives special witness that, above and beyond earthly values, there is something we call the kingdom of God. While religious life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s characteristic witness is spe-cial, it is not exclusive. It is the duty of all Christians to give witness to the kingdom of God. All Christians, be they lay or religious, are committed to living out their baptismal consecration. Emphasis on the common voca-tion of all Christians highlights what is of fundamental importance, the fullness of Christian life informed by charity. That emphasis also counteracts any tendency to draw unfavorable comparisons between the lay and religious states, as though laypersons are somehow sec-ond- class citizens or \\\\\"children of a lesser God.\\\\\" That broad emphasis on all Christian life is rooted in the most ancient tradition of monasticism. In his masterful study The Spirituality of the New Testament and the Fathers, Louis Bouyer finds certain constants in the literature of monasticism. He affirms them because they were some-what obscured by later developments. One such insight is that the primitive monk did not appear special. Whether by himself or others, his vocation was not considered par-ticular or exceptional. The monk was simply a Christian, a devout layperson who took the most radical means to live the Christian life to the fullest. The monk proposed no other end than to be saved. All his life, the monk asked for no other teaching from his elders than the means of attaining that goal. His fundamental and persistent ques-tion was: \\\\\"Tell me. How can I be saved?\\\\\" Two points need emphasis. First, holiness, the fullness of Christian life, is not something reserved Review for Religious to religious, while laypersons are called to something less. Second, religious are to focus on the essential, on the search for union with God, and not see holi-ness as something incidental or distinctive which sets them apart from \\\\\"ordinary\\\\\" Christians. Fundamental to religious identity is one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity as a Christian. It is the fullness of the Christian experience that constitutes Christian identity. There are three major elements in the Christian expe-rience. The first is not distinctively Christian. It is the human preamble. It consists in discovering that human happiness and fulfillment are not brought about by tak-ing. We all start out that way, looking for that certain something or combination of things which, if we could only latch on to it and make it our own, would provide fulfillment. The Christian experience becomes possible once we realize that what we really seek is something or someone to give ourselves to, something or someone greater and nobler than ourself. It is a search for some-thing or someone that will endow our life with meaning and purpose. Finding that something or someone is the beginning of faith as a lived reality. It becomes the basis of all commitment worthy of the name. The second element makes the experience specifi-cally Christian. It consists in finding that greater-than-self reality in the person of Jesus Christ. It is finding in his words meaning for our life. It is finding in his life the pattern and model for our own. The third element is the desire to share what we have found. We want others to find the meaning and purpose that have become our own. We want to live out this meaning and purpose in love for one another. The full Christian experience, then, is apostolic and missionary. 381 68.4 2009 Clark * Revisiting Reli#ous Identity 382 If this Christian experience is not real in our lives, no amount of theorizing about what it is or should be will ever make it so. Furthermore, theorizing will not help much in our lives as religious. If the Christian experience is real, it can be progressively liberating, freeing from all those attitudes of mind and spirit that limit us to operating within the narrow confines of self-ish interests. Like all Christians, religious are to give witness by their lives to the possibilities open to everyone for liber-ation from enslaving attitudes like inordinate ambition, defensiveness, possessiveness, self-pity, and cynicism. The life of religious should also be an active witness to joy, to hope, and to love. The call to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity seems so daunting that peo-ple often try to evade its challenge. In doing so, lay-persons sometimes say that holiness is something for religious and priests, not for \\\\\"ordinary\\\\\" persons like themselves. Likewise, religious sometimes find a type of escape through dependence on the system. Religious life involves a kind of system that includes public vows, constitutions and rules, and a goodly number of prac-tices found in the traditions of various religious insti-tutes. We might think just plugging into the system will make us as holy as we need to be. It is easy to just coast along. All too easily we can come to rate as virtue whatever is conformable to our religious surroundings. Custom and routine can so enslave us as to dispense us from personal decision. Of course, custom and routine, as well as the regular practices and exercises of religious life, are also great helps--if we understand and use them righdy. They do not, however, carry us all the way. They reflect the fact Review for Religious that in choosing to be religious we have set the direction of our lives. But they do not guarantee we never lose that direction. The need for ongoing renewal is simply the need to reaffirm, to reset our direction. The human condition is such that nothing can be taken for granted except the constancy of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace, of his invitation. Another point on which the council spoke explic-itly is religious consecration. Everyone of the faithful is consecrated to the divine service by baptism. Clearly, in various contexts the word \\\\\"consecration\\\\\" has various meanings, causing difficulties to be raised about how this idea applies to religious. In address-ing those difficulties, the council begins by relating religious con-secration to baptism. Religious consecra-tion adds nothing to the baptism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sacramental character. It is, however, in the line of baptismal grace. That grace can be lived in varying degrees of intimacy. The coun-cil speaks of religious as being \\\\\"more intimately conse-crated to the divine service.\\\\\" That phrase is significant. It does not say \\\\\"more strictly\\\\\" or anything that might seem to emphasize some form of legal obligation. What the council points out by those words is that baptismal consecration can be interiorized to a greater or lesser extent by grace and by love. Ultimately, the truth of every Christian life consists in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s baptismal consecration. But God calls people to live out that consecration in different ways. For religious The call to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity seems so daunting that people often try to evade its challenge. 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity the call to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service is more explicitly determined. It takes on a particular form or style. To put that a bit differently, for religious the vital response called for by God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loving initiative is made concrete in a specific and distinctive way. By making a certain explicit profession of the evan-gelical counsels, persons technically become religious. The purpose of such profession is to commit ourselves more explicitly and more profoundly to living our bap-tismal consecration. At one time religious profession was commonly called \\\\\"a new baptism\\\\\" in homilies at profession ceremonies. In those days it was not always adequately explained. The council statements revitalized and clarified that idea. In reflecting on religious consecration, it is important to realize that such consecration is the work of God. Virtually every page of Scripture speaks of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initiative in regard to creatures. Jesus told his disciples: \\\\\"You have not chosen me. I have chosen you.\\\\\" Passages like that have a particular resonance for religious. It is God who calls religious and consecrates them through the church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ministry. Because it is God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work, religious consecration is permanent. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice and God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fidelity are unchanging. God is constant in the grace he offers, in his call. Our challenge is to keep trying to respond generously to that call. Religious consecration represents a special instance of the mysterious interaction between grace and human freedom. Obviously it is essential that those consecrat-ing themselves to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service be free. At the same time we must recognize that the consecration is ulti-mately God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. Religious profession has never been considered a sacrament by the church. In recent years many things have been referred to as \\\\\"sacraments,\\\\\" in a broad sense Review for Religiot~s of the word. In the strict sense, religious profession is not a sacrament. That does not mean, however, that religious profession has no reality beyond the disposi-tion and conduct of the subject. Religious consecration is something accorded to free persons precisely as free. To be received, the consecra-tion requires a personal response to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call. That response includes certain characteristics. It must be sufficiently enlightened, conscious, and free. A person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention and the vows which formulate that intention are eminently free acts. Conversely, when the church dispenses from vows, she judges that in reality there was some impediment to freedom in the original profes-sion, something lacking in what was offered for divine consecration. The fact that religious consecra-tion is not a sacrament does not mean nothing more is involved than the liberty of the one making vows. On God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part the engagement is indefectible. A vocation consists in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being called to a cer-tain manner of life. Each vocation has its own structure and laws. Those laws are not to be understood as some-thing imposed from the outside. They derive from the very nature of the life in question. To ignore structure and laws proper to religious life would be to think of reli-gious life as funny putty which can take on any shape one gives it. History shows significant variations in the forms of religious life. But, in the last analysis, that life must always be directly related to what is most fundamental in Christianity, the search for God and growth in charity. A vocation consists in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being called to a certain manner of life. 68.4 2009 Clark * Revisiting Religious Identity In the Christian understanding of life, the goal is progress in charity. Jesus made it clear that love of God and love of neighbor sum up the whole law. Love gives ultimate value to what we do. That is why religious con-secration is wholly directed towards love of God and neighbor. It is precisely that love which gives the value of consecration to the activity of the religious. The idea that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities must continuously be animated by charity is certainly not new. We have heard it countless times in one form or another. Nor is it distinctive. It is true for everyone. By religious profession we are committed to that goal more explicitly, more officially, as it were. On the part of religious, the consecration of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life consists in using distinctive means for achieving the common Christian goal of progress in charity. My cir-cumstances, my state of life, determine the means that are most appropriate for me. Jacques Maritain offered an excellent definition of means. He said means are the end in the process of coming to be. Thus, at each moment of our journey toward the perfection of love, we make that end real by employing the appropriate means, Perhaps we should emphasize the word \\\\\"journey.\\\\\" While we hope we are on the right road and we try to keep moving in the right direction, we never reach the end, the perfection of love, in this life. Another way to put that is to say that holiness is not so much a place we arrive as it is the way we travel. Consciousness of our shortcomings and failures makes us reluctant to think of ourselves as holy. A num-ber of years ago Archbishop John Roach of St. Paul, in a pastoral letter on spirituality titled A Friendship Unlimited, offered a valuable insight in this regard. He wrote: \\\\\"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a funny thing, but for years I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imag- Review for Religious ine thinking of myself as holy. I was equating holiness with perfection, and I knew I simply didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that. It is clear to me now that holiness is the desire to be a friend of Jesus Christ and to surrender my will to God. I may stumble along with that. I have so far--but, so long as I continue a sincere effort toward that goal, I am holy.\\\\\" It might help also to remind ourselves of one charac-teristic of holiness that is often overlooked. It is compat-ible with human frailty. Many stories and most statues of saints give a wrong impression, an impression of otherworldliness that obscures the fact that those saints were real human beings with human faults and weak-nesses. Examples are plentiful. St. Augustine was given to rages. St. Thtr~se of Lisieux had bouts of depression. St. Vincent de Paul, the great saint of charity, was said to be bilious and subject to fits of anger. St. Jerome was aggressive and insulting to persons who disagreed with him. In fact, one of his contemporaries said of Jerome that his malice was such that no saint could live within miles of him. The secret of all of those people is that they never gave up struggling and working to overcome their human weaknesses. They knew what counts is not the triumphant victory of total perfection, but persevering effort. Teresa of Avila said we should strive and strive and strive, for we were made for nothing else. She was right, of course, but the way she said it makes it sound hard. And it is a constant challenge. We cannot gloss over that. But I like the way T.S. Eliot put it when he said: \\\\\"We are only undefeated because we keep 6n trying.\\\\\" In question 186 of the Secunda Secundae of his Summa Theologiae, St. Thomas treats of things that per-tain to the religious state. He speaks at length of the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and argues their ,387 68.4 2009 Clark \\xc2\\xaf Revisiting Religious Identity necessity for religious perfection. He points out that \\\\\"a person cannot offer his whole life to God directly because that life is not lived all at once, but only suc-cessively. Hence, a person can only offer his whole life to God through the obligation imposed by vows\\\\\" (my translation). Thus, our real challenge is not the perfor-mance of heroic acts, however beautiful, however noble, for every human act is by nature transitory. Our real challenge is the heroism of a whole life, offered to God without measure, without reservation, without regret. This is done through religious consecration, through the vows. And in this the entire person, mind and heart, must be involved and permanently involved. Note \\xe2\\x80\\x99 The Vatican translation and the revised Flannery translation, melded. See Lumen gentium, chapter 6, \\xc2\\xa744: \\\\\"Regni Dei denique super omnia terrestria elevationem eiusque summas necessitudines peculiari modo patefacit [status religiosus]\",\"supereminentem quoque magnitudi-nem virtutis Christi regnantis atque infinitam Spiritus Sancti potentiam in Ecclesia mirabiliter operantem, cunctis hominibus demonstrat.\\\\\" Ed. 388 Questions for Personal and Group Reflection If religious sisters and brothers are identified with the laity, how do you claim their special religious identity? 2.

Review for Religious LEO J. HERIOT Encounters Early and Late: John Bosco and Paul Saul was present at the stoning of the lov-able Stephen, and perhaps this increased the Pharisee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire for Christian blood. Fernand Prat says, \\\\\"Not content with being present at the torture of the victims, he entered into houses and dragged out the inmates, both men and women, to hale them to the dungeons.\\\\\"\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Saul set out on the trail of Christians not to evangelize them but in pursuit of them to bring them to what he thought was justice. He had asked the priests to give him the offi-cial mission to seek out Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disciples in the synagogue of Damascus and drag them before the Sanhedrin. In the Acts of the Apostles we have three accounts of the vision on the way to Damascus (9:1-19\",\"22:3-21\",\"26:12-20). It is Luke who makes the first announcement of Leo J. Heriot SDB wrote for us about Margaret Bosco in 2007. His address is now Don Bosco House\",\"PMB Government Buildings\",\"Suva, Fiji-Islands. exemplars of faith 389 68.4 2009 Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Encounters Early and Late this event\",\"later we hear Paul giving his own account. The accounts agree on the important points: the occa-sion, the place, the time of day, the dazzling light, Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fall to the ground, his dialogue with the mysterious voice, his blindness, the return of his sight, and the total change in his life. From being a firebrand of a persecutor, he became a sower of the Good News of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The whole change of his behavior, his heeding of the strong voice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, and his subsequent dedica-tion to a new cause make us aware that he was not led by fanaticism or goaded on by personal ambition. Jesus Christ seized him, pulled him close to himself. From the accounts of this conversion, nothing presaged it, noth-ing hinted that the fierce Pharisee would change regard-ing this person Jesus Christ, changing and becoming a disciple of Jesus and a preeminent apostle. Looking at this conversion, one gets the impression that it is beyond human explanation. It would be folly to try to find some simple plausible human causality. Pauline theology gives pride of place to the empow-erment of grace, and Saul was certainly under the influence of grace. It is not possible to explain this con-version apart from divine grace. Paul helps us with these assertions from his writings: \\\\\"Have I not seen Jesus, our Lord?\\\\\" (1 Co 9:1). \\\\\"Last of all, as one untimely born, he appeared also to me\\\\\" (1 Co 15:8). Grace found in this man fertile soil that would produce a great extension of the stoW of Jesus, a stoW that would make people aware of the immense, unfolding gift God gave to Saul and to the world on Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way to Damascus. Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s encounter with the risen Lord as he sought to obliterate that Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message had a huge influence on him. One of the Apostle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boldest and most profound Review for Religious teachings was that of Christians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 being incorporated into Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mystical body. For this Pharisee, Paul, Christ becomes all in all\",\"Christ becomes everything. This idea is contained in seminal form in the question Jesus puts to the blinded Saul: \\\\\"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\\\\\" (Ac 9:4). Paul was not attacking Jesus directly\",\"he was defending his Pharisaism by trying to prevent Jews from falling into the ways of this crucified \\\\\"reformer\\\\\" of Judaism. In Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversion God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace is evident, work-ing a transformation immediately. It is like the blinding flash of light. The extraordinary illumination appar-ently brought about Saul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate com-pliance with Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 words and his swift transformation into a disciple and apostle. The stunned Saul changed his course once and for all. He found himself in a new world, a world almost alien to the life he had lived until then. Paul was overwhelmed by a new faith, a belief in the person of Jesus Christ as his Lord and master. He began a new and demanding life that only a strong and deep faith and love could sustain. He expresses that faith in his Letters to the Galatians and the Romans, an active faith that revolutionizes the whole person and alters the direction of people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives. From the moment of his conversion the gaze of Saul is riveted on the person of Jesus Christ. We would go too far, however, if we reduced Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to the moment One of the Apostle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boldest and most profound teachings was that of Christians\\\\\" being incorporated into Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mystical body. 391 68.4 2009 Heriot \\xc2\\xaf Encounters Early and Late of his conversion. His continuing deep reflection on the mystery of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love strengthened him as he went about his apostolic life. Our beliefs, too, are not simply the result of our reading or reflection, but come from God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communication with us, often in the quiet con-templation of a Divine Master stretching out his hand to us and telling us to find him in our contemplative awareness of others and ourselves. 392f The Boy from Becchi, Another Man of Zeal In an audience on 21 March 1858, Pope Pius IX, now Blessed, told the priest from Turin: \\\\\"When you get back to Turin, Don Bosco, you write down these dreams and everything else you have told me, minutely, and in their natural sense. Save all this as a legacy for your Congregation so that it may serve as an encouragement and norm for your Sons.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x992 After nine years this same pope questioned him once again. Don Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply was \\\\\"I truthfully lacked the time. I was so taken with [any number of things].\\\\\" The pope said, \\\\\"Well then, I not only advise you, but order you to do it.\\\\\" Don Bosco promised to write down his early experiences, and he kept his word.3 In his poor handwriting Don Bosco scrawled out his first dream. \\\\\"At the age of nine I had a dream that really changed my life and influenced me throughout my life. I dreamed I was near my house at Becchi, and a crowd of young boys had gathered there to have fun and play games. Some were playing, some were laughing, and not a few were cursing. Shocked by their expres-sions, I jumped in among the boys, swinging wildly and shouting at them to stop saying those things. At that moment a Person appeared among us. He was dressed in a long white robe, and his face radiated such light Review for Religious that I could not look at it. Suddenly he called me by name. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Giovanni, you have to win these boys not by blows but with gendeness and kindness (bont~). So begin right now to show them that evil is ugly and virtue is beautiful.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\\" Although these words confused him, this little boy, nine years old in 1824, was being commissioned for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. He said, \\\\\"I am so small and these are young men. What you are asking me to do seems to be impos-sible.\\\\\" But he was told: \\\\\"What seems so impossible, you must achieve by being obedient and acquiring knowledge.\\\\\" The boy shouted, \\\\\"You ask me to do the impossible!\\\\\" The voice said, \\\\\"I will give you a teacher under whose guid-ance you will learn and without whose help all knowl-edge becomes foolishness.\\\\\" Beside this Person stood the Lady to whom young Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother had taught him to pray regularly. The Lady, taking his hand, said, \\\\\"Giovanni, look carefully. What do you see?\\\\\" The crowd of boys was changed into goats, dogs, cats, bears, and various other animals. The Lady of his dream said to him, startlingly: \\\\\"This is your field of labor.\\\\\" Then she gave him a one-word recipe for getting these boys to improve: \\\\\"amorevolezza\\\\\" (loving concern). The wild animals disappeared, having been turned into sheep. The Lady then told him, \\\\\"In due time you will understand,\\\\\" and with that she put her hand on his head. At table for morning coffee he told his family about his dream. Each one said something different. His \\\\\"At the age of nine I had a dream that really changed my life and influenced me throughout my life.\\\\\" 393 68.4 2009 Heriot * Encounters Early and Late brother Joseph said, \\\\\"Oh, Giovanni, you are going to become a farmer looking after sheep and goats, caring for them.\\\\\" His brother Anthony said, \\\\\"Oh, Giovanni, you are going to become the leader of a gang of ban-dits!\\\\\" After other such remarks, their wise old grand-mother said in an authoritarian tone: \\\\\"Giovanni, take no notice of dreams.\\\\\" And Mama Margaret said con-vincingly, \\\\\"Prepare yourself, Giovanni, for your future apostolate.\\\\\" This, then, is what Pope Pius IX referred to in 1858 when he told Don Bosco: \\\\\"This is the begin-ning and the foundation of your work. Give this dream to your Congregation and make it a part of their life.\\\\\" On the road to Damascus, Paul was astonished by the voice that changed his life. It had the power to change his life and send him on a new mission. While any comparison of nine-year-old John Bosco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream to Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience near Damascus would be lopsided, we may remind ourselves that both of them were impelled into a new life, a new apostolate, by mysterious expe-riences beyond usual explanation. Are there not many other divinely wondrous experiences as well? Why not keep them in mind?

After I entered, the prioress asked me to choose a patron, and I chose St. Hilda of Whitby. Initially I hesitated to choose her because, generally speaking, we do not know much about her. We know when she was born and died, where she lived, and some of the activities she pursued, activities for which she was well known and respected. But we know little about her character, her spirit, or her inner life. How did the tone of a gathering change when she walked into a room? How did she regard those whose lives and souls were entrusted to her care? Was her glance warm or cool? Did she have a glint in her eye? Answers to these ques-tions seemed permanently unavailable. A few months after I entered my community, I attended a concert given by Festival Chorale Oregon, Hilda Kleiman OSB writes from Queen of Angels Monastery\",\"840 S. Main Street\",\"Mt. Angel, Oregon 97362. Email: ajkjune@juno.com 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby a local, award-winning choir directed by Dr. Solveig Holmquist. I had been a student in her college choir for three years at Western Oregon University. I was excited to see her again, even from a distance, even from the back as she conducted the choir. When she entered the concert hall, she was as I had remembered--not tall or physically imposing, yet filled with a presence that shot through her spiky hair, her sharp eyes, and her earrings and many bracelets. I saw a woman in full possession of herself and the situation at hand. She stood before the choir and the orchestra, and they knew what to do sim-ply by the movements of her hands and a thin baton. I remembered standing before her with my eyes on every move she made. In every gesture, every expression, she embodied musician and conductor. She made the vocalists and musicians one as we let her lead us--as, with our minds but also our hearts, we let her be our breath to the very last note. When Dr. Holmquist arrived at Western, she had clearly learned how to draw people together. Shortly after being hired, she was told there were no students at Western who could really sing. Given that this was untrue, and even uncharitable, Dr. Holmquist did not listen. She simply set up a table at the activities fair at the beginning of the school year and started signing students up for auditions. By the end of the year, she had set the choral music program on its feet, doubling the size of the choir, planning tours, and establishing a student-led choir council. I began to see that music was Dr. Holmquist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, and part of that life was invit-ing the rest of us into the music in whatever way was appropriate for each of us. I loved her for it, and I still do. Though I do not think I would have used the word at the time, I see now Review for Religious that what I received from Dr. Holmquist was a deep and vigorous image of vocation. I have no doubt that through the music she is doing what God created her to do. Shortly before I graduated, I tried to say as much to her. In her office one morning, I described what I saw in her. I said I was not a born musician like her, but rather a writer and a reader, and I was looking for my own purpose in life. The day I attended the Festival Chorale concert was November 17th, the feast day of St. Hilda, and the first time I observed her feast day as my own. As I watched and remembered Dr. Holmquist, some of the reasons why I choose Hilda began to emerge. It was not about wanting to be an abbess as Hilda was, any more than it was about wanting to be a cho- , ral conductor. It was not about imitation in such a specific sense, but about living in the presence of someone who could play a part in calling me to be who I am supposed to be and to do what I am meant to do. It was about the profound effect just one person who is living her vocation may have on those around her. If I imagined myself as a member of Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monastery, much as I had been a member of Dr. Holmquist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choir, what could I learn about who I am supposed to be here and now? It was about the profound effect just one person who is living her vocation may have on those around her. 397 The Venerable Bede, an English monk and writer of the 8th century, is our sole source of historical infor- 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby marion on Hilda. After serving as the abbess of several monasteries, she established at Whitby a double monas-tery, a community of monks and nuns. In his history of the English church, Bede tells us she taught those within her community to study the Scriptures thoroughly, to observe good works, and to foster many virtues, \\\\\"but especially peace and charity.\\\\\" In part, the influence of her goodness was seen in the five outstanding men from her monastery who became bishops. In addition to her own monks and nuns, others from all walks of society sought her direction. In this way Hilda, \\\\\"whom all her acquaintances called Mother because of her wonderful devotion and grace,\\\\\" guided many people to God along the path of their particular gifts and circumstances. Bede also gives us the story of Caedmon, a shy sheep-herder whom \\\\\"God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace made remarkable.\\\\\" One night Caedmon received a vision from God in which a man asked him to compose and sing him a song. Caedmon answered that he could not sing, and the man replied \\\\\"But you shall sing to me,\\\\\" and he did, thus becom-ing the first poet of the English language. When Hilda learned of Caedmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gift, she invited him to become a monk and be instructed in sacred history, which he then rendered into beautiful music and poetry. Caedmon soon became not just a poet but a disciplined and beloved member of the community as well. At his death he asked if there were any who held any ill will against him, and he was assured that there was not. When then asked if he was at peace with those attending him, he replied, \\\\\"I am at peace with all the servants of God.\\\\\" Among well-known events of church history, Whitby is known as the site of the synod in 664 at which the controversy between the Celtic and Roman dates for observing Easter was resolved. The problem disturbed Review for Religious many people, Bede tells us, even to the point that they feared \\\\\"that they might have received the name Christian in vain.\\\\\" Those arguing for the Roman date were victo-rious, yet Bede describes Hilda and her community as favoring the Celtic practice. While he tells us the results of the synod, Bede does not describe Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to the decision. We do not know if in the end she was saddened, relieved, or pleased. From what we do know about her leadership, however, we can perhaps assume that many looked to Hilda for guidance as to how they should respond to this decision. We can see the great respect she had for the Scriptures and the wisdom of the church. We can see that she taught those around her to be of service in all peace and charity. Even as she neared her death, she urged those in her monastery to \\\\\"maintain the gospel peace among themselves and with others.\\\\\" I imagine that Hilda had a profound sense of perspective, of knowing, in the end, which beliefs and practices held priority. Unity within the church mat-tered more than any particular date, and gracious accep-tance of the decision of the synod mattered more than the content of the arguments. I was aware of St. Hilda before I was a Catholic because I attended St. Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Episcopal Church for sev-eral years during high school and college. St. Hilda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is a small community\",\"the church holds perhaps fifty peo-ple on a Sunday. I met the vicar, Noel Knelange, when I first arrived, and about a year later Noel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband Bill was ordained a deacon. I attended the ordination and sang in the choir, helping to lead the congregation out of the church singing \\\\\"The King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Highway\\\\\" for the recessional. During the service I was taken aback 399 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Whitby Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordination gave me the image of dedicating one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to God alone, and Noel, bluntly and without~ pretense\",\"connected ~that image, to me, 400] by the beauty of the liturgy and the fact that Bill was grounding his life and identity in his faith. Somehow God wanted him. God wanted exactly who Bill was, a middle-aged man, a deaf man deeply involved with the deaf community of the diocese, a man who loved to fish so much that during the homily the bishop gave him a new fishing pole, now that he would be a fisher of men. Afterwards, during the reception in the parish hall, I was standing near Bill and Noel, probably eating a cookie, when Noel turned to me and said, \\\\\"Well, you could do this too you know!\\\\\" What? I did not want to be a deacon or a priest. I did not understand why she said that, and we never talked about it later. I forgot about Noel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words until after I had become a Catholic and been a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel, Oregon, for several years--even though I had often wondered when the thought of becoming a nun first came to me. Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ordination gave me the image of dedicating one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to God alone, and Noel, bluntly and without pretense, connected that image to me. The seed of the idea of staking everything on \\\\\"the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen,\\\\\" as we read in the Letter to the Hebrews, was planted and would take root in ways I never suspected. Just a few years Review for Religious later, I was led to the Catholic Church, to a Benedictine monastery, and to a surprising new relationship with St. Hilda, a relationship reflected in women like Solveig Holmquist and Noel Knelange. Regardless of whether they were aware of all the details, they could and would change the course of a life in a single breath, with a single word. The name Hilda comes from the Old English and means \\\\\"Battle Maiden,\\\\\" a fact I learned only after I received the official word from .the prioress that I could take Hilda as my new name at my final profession. I took to the image of the Battle Maiden immediately--the tension between toughness and gentleness, knowledge and innocence, between what we think we know and what we in fact do not, a tension not to be resolved but used as ingeniously as possible until the day of death. Other people have taken to my choice of the name Hilda, to the \\\\\"Batde Maiden\\\\\" too. \\\\\"Battle on, maiden!\\\\\" says my mom before she hangs up the phone. After ask-ing me to explain the meaning of Hilda to my class-mates, one of my seminary professors warns that \\\\\"from now on, you gendemen better look out!\\\\\" The best, how-ever, is my friend Ania. With her I have established The Society of Honorary Battle Maidens. We have taken as our charter the words of St. Paul to the Corinthians: \\\\\"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not driven to despair, persecuted, but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed, always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.\\\\\" To bet- 401 68.4 2009 Kleiman \\xc2\\xaf On Hilda of Wbitby ter understand our society, I have listed qualities of the Battle Maiden, which include the following and will surely be added to as I ponder this further: \\xc2\\xaf A persistent love, grounded in the love of God that pursues us without end. She can keep extending her love for other people, regardless of how they respond, if at all. If she feels hurt by this, she takes it to mean that her efforts were not the most gracious way to love this particular person, and it is time to try something else. She is intelligent, so her persistence does not suggest beating her head against a wall, but rather keeping her wits about her and being willing, always willing, to try again. \\xc2\\xaf The beginning of an understanding of the fourth step of humility in the Rule of St. Benedict: \\\\\"The fourth step of humility is that, in this obedience under diffi-cult, unfavorable, or even unjust conditions, his [or her] heart quietly embraces suffering and endures it without weakening or seeking escape.\\\\\" She does not, in the end, resent that this step asks her to endure injustice, even contradiction, for the sake of the God she loves. She accepts that sometimes such endurance will require her to speak her mind, to name what is difficult, recognizing that endurance can be more than just waiting for the bad to run its course. Bravery of heart becomes part of her core. She understands that false sisters and broth-ers (and are not we all false and contradictory at one time or another) are part of reality\",\"to deny this is of no use to anyone. She uses their words and actions to strengthen her reliance on the Lord so that it remains possible for her to pray for her enemies. \\xc2\\xaf An enduring kindness that she tries to exercise in any situation, par.ticularly in her words. At times, she may manifest her kindness in ways that are more tra- Review for Religious ditionally recognized as kindness--offering to lend a hand in household tasks, greeting guests with courtesy and assisting them in their needs, acknowledging the accomplishments of others with a sincere compliment. Kindness, however, is also needed in more challenging situations. It is a kindness to try to change the sub-ject when she hears murmuring or gossip about some-one who is not present. It is a kindness to walk away and not participate even by listening when this tactic fails, perhaps biting back the words rising in her throat that she would like to put everyone in their place with. Kindness calls her to address only in private any embar-rassing situations that involve another person, so as not to worsen the pain her words would likely cause if spo-ken publicly. To enjoy membership in The Society of Honorary Battle Maidens, you and I do not need to be in full possession of these qualities. We do need, however, to recognize their worth and strive to live with their inher-ent tensions, tensions that in the end are simply the tensions of the cross.

Teresa Burleson 403 68.4 2009 Vv\\xe2\\x80\\x99ILLIAM PROSPERO World Youth Day and Religious Life sharing experience 40_4] Many vocation directors will confirm that a substantial number of candidates for seminar-ies and institutes of consecrated life consider a World Youth Day (WYD) experience to have been an important part of their discernment. Many candidates say they first thought seri-ously about religious life or the priesthood while on a WYD pilgrimage. What is it about WYD that promotes consecrated life? Sister Joseph Andrew, of the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, asked me to speak about this very topic at a recent discernment retreat at the motherhouse in Ann Arbor. No less than a hundred \\xe2\\x80\\x99thirty young women attended. When I asked how many had been to WYD, about one third raised their hands. The main reason for \\\\\"only\\\\\" a third, I William Prospero SJ is pastor of St. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s University Parish (on the campus of Central Michigan University)\",\"1405 South Washington\",\"Mount Pleasant, Michigan 48858. Emaih will.prospero@stmarycmu.org Review for Religious believe, is that most of them were too young to have attended any other WYD than the one in 2008 in Sydney, Australia. Sydney did not draw huge numbers from the United States because of the travel cost. Nonetheless, many of the young women present had managed to attend that WYD. I believe there are several reasons why WYD pro-motes consecrated life and priesthood. Though I do not have any statistical analysis to prove my points, I have a wealth of experience assisting young WYD pil-grims in their discernment about consecrated life or priesthood. I have attended four WYDs: Denver (1993), Toronto (2002), Cologne (2005), and Sydney (2008). I have served as a priest on the last three. I have wit-nessed more than ten pilgrims enter religious life or the seminary. The main reason, I believe, for the wealth of WYD vocations is that WYD gives a taste of life as a conse-crated person. Pilgrims experience about two weeks of consecrated living. WYD provides a veritable \\\\\"trial run\\\\\" of living the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In. living the vows on WYD, pilgrims experience the intense joy of the universal church gathered around the pope. They make the connection that living as a religious could be enjoyable and meaningful. The possibility of consecrated vocation becomes real for the first time in many pilgrims\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. Pilgrims experience poverty the first day of com-mitting to go on WYD. They realize that the costs can be high. As I began recruiting for Sydney, I recall sev-eral students resisting, sa.ying $2,850 was too costly. My response was: \\\\\"Do you want to go? Has God put this desire in your heart? If so, then commit and the money will come. I promise. And, if not, I will personally cover 405 68.4 2OO9 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf World Youth Day and Religious Life Trusting God for material needs is a tangible experience of religious poverty. 406 whatever you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But you must promise you will com-mit to this and try your best to raise the funds. I prom-ise you, God will provide.\\\\\" Every pilgrim had enough funds. On four WYDs I have never met a pilgrim who fell short of funds. For the 2008 WYD in Sydney, we took seventy pilgrims from the Diocese of Saginaw, each paying $2,850. There are stories of pilgrims finding funds flow-ing in from fund-raisers and from the most unexpected sources. Trusting God for material needs is a tangible experience of reli-gious poverty: God provides. Pilgrims trust him, and all works out. From the beginning, they learn that those who commit to a reli-gious pilgrimage are cared for by God. They learn this throughout WYD, beginning with their first moment of commitment. Poverty finds many manifestations, usually very inconvenient ones. As the pilgrimage officially begins, I speak of the \\\\\"great ball of suffering\\\\\" that one endures on WYD. For some reason, chaos and inconvenience reign. This makes trusting God mandatory, not optional. For example, because of delayed flights, our travel time from our departure to our host parish in Kiama, south of Sydney, was thirty-eight hours. And the last two hours were in a bus with a broken heater (it was winter there) while rain and forty Fahrenheit degrees of damp cold were welcoming us. These horrendous situations created the proper spirit in which to celebrate Mass, Revie\",\"v for Religious namely, our sense of spiritual and actual poverty: \\\\\"We are not in control!\\\\\" Having celebrated Mass at a crowded boarding gate in the Los Angeles airport (LAX), we found special meaning in celebrating Mass again, hungry and cold, at the very end of our trip. I was reminded of the four thousand hungry and tired people in Mark 6:1-8 who were worn out from their journey, so Jesus fed them. It was as if Jesus intentionally brought the people out to a deserted place to experience their poverty and to see and taste the goodness of God. Poverty makes pilgrims hungry for Jesus. Another example of poverty happened at the Papal Welcome at Sydney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harbor. Afterwards we were hun-gry and cold. Several pilgrims collected our chits or tickets and got our meals, bags of hot stew (option: beef or pork). After getting the same victuals several days in a row, pilgrims were cheerfully dubbing them \\\\\"barf bags.\\\\\" Our meals were being eaten on the ground or on cement blocks or wherever we could prop ourselves up. One night, however, several alert pilgrims found some plastic chairs and brought enough over for the group of seventy to sit. We could sit and eat! We were so grate-ful. I cannot recall ever feeling so grateful for having a chair to sit on. This is what WYD does: it makes the ordinary into a gift from God. Once one begins to see that everything, everything, is a gift, then one can start living a radical Christian life. So the gift of sitting, eat-ing, enjoying each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company, and basking in the reality that we just saw in person the Vicar of Christ, all add up to an explosive experience of the joys of the kingdom. Poverty makes human experience more real, and opens us to the true value of community. How sim-ple and uncomplicated it all is. 407 68.4 2009 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf Worm Youth Day and Religious Life Over and over one witnesses pilgrims making sacrifices for the sake of the group. 4081 If pilgrims are properly prepared and guided, they have a wonderful experience of interacting positively with the opposite sex. Even sleeping conditions, oth-erwise inappropriate, become an experience of intense respect and honor of boundaries. One sees the \\\\\"other\\\\\" as sacred and as a fellow pilgrim on the way, some-one to be honored and respected. I have never known of any of our pil-grims engaging in actions that are meant for mar-ried couples. Sleeping shoulder to shoulder with two thousand other pilgrims may seem cause for temptation and raised eyebrows, but never have I seen anything but excellent moral behavior among our pilgrims. Even where there are dating couples, they hardly ever \\\\\"pair off\\\\\" from the group. The whole atmosphere is one of intense commu-nal living. People are attentive to the needs of everyone, sharing and caring for one another. The pilgrim learns that one does not need to pursue or engage in roman-tic relationships to be happy. Celibacy for the kingdom becomes tangible, livable, and enjoyable. At WYD the intense communal activities, which sometimes involve distressing conditions and both-ersome inconveniences that must be endured, build a joyful esprit de corps. Over and over one witnesses pilgrims making sacrifices for the sake of the group. Opportunities for minor sacrifices abound, such as shar-ing personal items to assist another in need and collect-ing meal tickets and standing in line to retrieve meals for a group. These and other sacrifices reveal acom- Review for Religious mon care for one another. Moreover, the group lead-ers have the ultimate say in all major decisions about travel, gatherings, agendas, and special needs that arise. Individual wills give way to the group, or to the lead-ers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions. Through these experiences one finds joy in sacrificing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own will for the good of the group, opening up to the gift of religious obedience. Consecrated persons make a sacrifice of their lives for the good of the church and the world. Pilgrims experience the power of loving sacrifice firsthand, and its power to build up the Body of Christ. Eddie Dwyer, a Saginaw seminarian, said: \\\\\"Three things I hate are lines, sitting on the floor, and crowded spaces, but the love at WYD made sacrifice easy.\\\\\" All these experiences find rich meaning in the cel-ebration of the sacraments, namely, confession and Eucharist. The intensity of confessions, celebrations of Holy Mass, and Eucharistic adoration affirms God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real presence among his people. All the sufferings and joys of pilgrimage are offered up to the Father in the won-derful exchange of gifts that the Eucharist makes real. All is gift. As a priest I am overwhelmed by the power and joy of the priesthood, by the sacramental fruitful-ness on WYD. What power can be manifested in such weakness! The Papal Mass at the conclusion of WYD provides the perfect environment for the overflowing gratitude of the pilgrimage to express itself. Pilgrims, freshly and deeply aware of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goodness, gratefully share their belongings with others. Jackets, caps, and an assortment of other personal items are offered and received in a wonderful exchange of gifts. God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kingdom becomes visible in everyone giving their things away to bring joy to both receiver and giver. In his Spiritual Exercises 409 68.4 2009 Prospero \\xc2\\xaf Worm Youth Day and Religious Life St. Ignatius Loyola speaks of the free exchange of gifts between those who love each other (\\xc2\\xa7231). This is the Christian life. As church and bride of Christ, we receive every good thing from God and make an offering of our very selves back to him in gratitude. This joyous exchange finds particular power at the Papal Mass. The accumulation and possession of .things no longer has appeal. The giving and receiving of love becomes the reason for existing. Consecrated life witnesses to the joy of the kingdom of heaven through the. gift of self to God. The Papal Mass provides a taste of the joy offered to those who radically take up the call to follow Christ the Bridegroom wherever he goes. As I lead pilgrims to WYD, I make a point of having several priests, seminarians, and religious sisters accom-pany us. When lay pilgrims rub shoulders with conse-crated persons, consecrated life now has a face, and that face is familiar and human. No longer is the question of consecrated life somewhere off in the distance, but it is real and lived by real people. The possibility of consecrated vocation opens up as the joys of serving the kingdom find witness. I count WYD the single most important vocation promotion ministry that I do. 410 Review for Religious BENNY PHANG Marriage and Celibacy: Rivals or Complements? MMarriage and celibacy are often seen as contraries. isunderstanding about these two vocations still exists among many people who do not fully under-stand celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven or the meaning of marriage. They see marriage as con-trary to celibacy, totally separated from it, and unable to contribute anything to it. And they understand celibacy as merely a pessimistic, negative rejection of married life and love. They even think celibacy is responsible for many sexual problems. About these matters people raise critical questions such as: Is marriage contrary to celibacy or even a rival? Is marriage a higher and better state than celibacy, or is it the other way around? Does marriage confirm celibacy or devalue it? If marriage confirms celibacy, how does it do so? Benny Phang OCarm, an Indonesian priest studying at the Angelicum for a doctorate in moral theology, can be addressed at Centro Internazionale Sant\\xe2\\x80\\x99Alberto\",\"Via Sforza Pallavicini, 10\",\"00193 Roma, Italy. Blog: theouiosoter.blogspot.com 411 68.4 2009 Pbang \\xc2\\xaf Marriage and Celibacy On this topic I want to draw some reflections from the messages of Pope John Paul II (collected in Theology of the Body), from the critical reflection on celibacy in the Catholic Church written by Aloysius Pieris sJ, and from the experience of St. Th~r~se of Lisieux of her vocation to religious life. Marriage and celibacy, are interrelated. To hurt either one by being unfaithful in it also hurts the other. 412- Rival Vocations? In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus places the counsel of celibacy in the discussion of the impor-tance of marriage, when he argues against divorce (Mt 19:3-12). Pope John Paul confirms this, saying, \\\\\"[From Matthew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, Mt 19:10-12], it can be seen sufficiently clearly that here it is not a question of diminishing the value of matrimony in favor of continence, nor of less-ening the value of one in comparison with the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 \\\\\"Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words on this point are quite clear. He proposes to his disciples the ideal of continence and the call to it, not by reason of the inferiority of, or of prejudice against, conjugal union in the body, but only for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x992 One can, however, argue for St. Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position when he writes, \\\\\"So then, he who marries his fiancee does well\",\"and he who refrains from marriage will do better\\\\\" (1 Co 7:38). Does this Pauline text not mean that mat-rimony is good, but celibacy for the kingdom of heaven is better?3 Review for Religious We need to comprehend the reason for celibacy in the evangelical counsel. Jesus says, \\\\\"There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can\\\\\" (Mt 19:12). This is the only reason for the evangelical counsel of celibacy. The reason is not to devalue marriage, but for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. To understand the \\\\\"difference\\\\\" between Jesus and Paul as regards celibacy and marriage, John Paul gives us an insight: In his pronouncement, did Christ perhaps suggest the superiority of continence for the kingdom of heaven to matrimony? Certainly he said that this is an excep-tional vocation, not a common one. In addition he affirmed that it is especially important and necessary to the kingdom of heaven. If we understand superiority to matrimony in this sense, we must admit that Christ set it out implicitly. However, he did not express it direcdy. Only Paul will say of those who choose matri-mony that they do \\\\\"well.\\\\\" About those who are willing to live in voluntary continence, he will say that they do \\\\\"better\\\\\" (! Co 7:38). (Theology, p. 275) The conscious and voluntary renunciation of the conjugal love of marriage and family life by celibate per-sons is not a devaluation of marriage, but it is a form of self-sacrifice.

Among the growing movements among American religious in the past few years has been the directed retreat. In increasing numbers, religious have placed themselves under a director who has guided their meditation for periods as long as thirty days.1 The movement owes much to the Jesuits, who have taken leadership throughout the countr~ in reviving an approach to the retreat that is closely linked with their own renewal and spirituality.2 There have been spinooffs from the directed retreat movement that sug-gest that directed retreats are much more than a passing fad, although for some they will take on that character. The first of the side benefits of the directed retreat movement has been that religious of a number of congregations, especially women, are being trained in the method and approach of directing prayer. The Jesuits have established centers for this purpose, and programs for training, using the Ignatian retreat, are well patronized. A congequence of this is the flowering of directed retreats among women religious,, and the better training of for-mation personnel capable of working with mature nuns. Secondly, the directed retreat seems to bring many religious to long-term spiritual direction. Foi\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the first time, for many religious, ~it has been possible--in a directed retreat--to consider spiritual direction as some- 1See, for example, Margaret Baker, H.V.M., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"My Experience of a Directed Retreat,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Review for Religious, v. 31 (1972), pp. 573-7\\\\\", \\\\\"Sister Christine Freed, R.G.S., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I Feel like Singing Forever,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Review ]or Religious, v. 32 (1973), pp. 1379-1384. \\xe2\\x80\\x99-\\xe2\\x80\\x99Thomas E.

While one can comment only impres-sionistically, it seems that a real phenomenon of the past three years has been the increased desire among religious for spiritual direction.:\\xe2\\x80\\x99 While the pattern is not so clear as to the expectations.of the religious seeking direction, the question of growth in prayer is always a serious considera-tion. The direction of prayer itself has an ancient and honorable tradition in the Church. From the earliest days of Christianity, the spiritual novice submitted himself or herself to a spiritual guide under whose direction growth in the life of prayer was undertaken. The stories of the fathers of the desert reinforce this strongly, and direction in prayer was for them an all-important issue in the relationship between novice and adept Chris-tian. The origins of this are obscure, but it would seem that the earliest forms of direction in prayer come from the baptismal catechesis, where the person responsible for the conversion of a neophyte not only helped in the education of the candidate for baptism, but particularly assumed the task of.teaching them the spiritual life. Together the two shared a period of prayer and \\xe2\\x80\\x99fasting before the administration of the sacrament.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In modern times, with the structure of the annual or other periodic retreat, various forms or styles of retreats came to the fore. The Ignatian r~treat has always had, in this period, a special place. It has been widely used b~, religious whose congregations are not Ignatian in spirituality, and its very basic Christian themes have made it equally.popular among lay-people. Although the preached retreat had become the predominant form, the notion of the directed retreat never died out, and its revival on such a large scale is in reality a return to an earlier Ignatian tradition. The Notion of the Directed Retreat The focus in the directed retreat is on the notion of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"directed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is a retreat in which the pfirticipant works with the retreat master in the man-ner of a s~iritual director. There is normally an hour-long interview each day, during which the retreatant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer is evaluated, directions and themes are~ given for further meditations, and the quality of the retreatant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is developed? As indicated above, although the nature of the directed retreat has ancient roots in the Church, it has been most characteristic o~ Jesuit re-aSee Sandra Marie Schneiders, I.H.M., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The \\xe2\\x80\\x99Return\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to Spiritual Direction,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Spiritual Lile, v. 18 (1972), pp. 263-78. 4Michel Dujarier, Le parrainage des adultes aux trois premiers siO(les de l\\xe2\\x80\\x99Eglise (Paris: 1962), p. 377. 5Herbert F.

This article is available from Review ]or Religious as a separate reprint. Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / ~259 treats in recent years. The point needs to be made that the nature of this retreat is simply the direction of prayer itself, adapted to the peculiar de-sign of a retreat, a period of time in which a person withdraws from ordi-nary pursuits to develop more consciously and deliberately in the spiritual life. Admittedly, among American religious other values have also entered in,, but this has always been understood as the essential purpose of retreat. For, a religious working far from the center of his province~ in a small community, the value of fellowship is a real one, for example. Some province retreats resemble a tribal gathering in this regard, and others use a workshop model rather than the traditional one of withdrawal for prayer. The comments that follow will be placed in the context of directed re-treats, but they might as easily apply to much of the real work of spiritual direction. Direction in prayer, even the special, concentrated form of di-rected meditation used in directed retreats, is the heart of spiritual direc-tion. An aspect of regular ~direction, even if relatively infrequent, is sug-gestions for prayer, the joint evaluation of movements in prayer, the dis-cernment of these movements, and help in heeding the call to new levels of prayer. The purpose of this article, however, is not to explore the nature and values, of the directed retreat, but to discuss its use to inculcate the values from the founding charism of a particular ~religious congregation. The question of the nature of th~ directed retreat has been explored in depth elsewhere.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" What has not been investigated at any point is how the tech-nique of the directed retreat can contribute to the deepening of the ~ommit-ment of a religious to his/her \\xc2\\xb0founding charism. Because non-Ignatian development of the directed retreat has been so\\xc2\\xb0limited, the paucity of in-formation on the topic is understandable. What follows here is based on the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study within the documents of his own order, as well as at-tempts to work with sisters of two other,groups attempting to find better means for developing their own spirituality within their members. The Founding Charism .In recent attempts among religious to heed the directives of Vatican II that they renew .themselves in the spirit of\\xe2\\x80\\x99their founders and foundresses, the emphasis has been placed upon research and the question of teaching the proper spirit of the order to cb.ndidates,r Along with this has gone the concern for finding newer expressions for the origina! teaching of the founder, while remaining faithful to his/her intent.

Review [or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 have been elements of both renewal and deception in the experience of getting in touch with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roots. In the directed retreat, the issue changes somewhat. The purpose of the retreat is not to analyze, speculate, or study. It is to experience the meaning of the life of the Lord in a renewed sense. It is to deepen one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer, and to deal with issues that affect the spiritual life. When we speak of a directed retreat designed to inculcate the values of the spirituality of a religious congregation, therefore, the point is that the important elements of that spirituality must be assembled in what may be new ways, intended to move the soul through prayer more than grouped in perfectly logical structures. The experiential dimension, and the very goal of the directed re-treat according to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own charism, is to bring the retreatant to the ex-perience that the founder had in founding the congregation. One must experience the foundation within oneself as a truly authentic, congruent integration of the spiritual life. It should make sense, bring an interior peace, and strongly confirm one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to this congregation at this time in history. Few religious have taken themselves, or been taken, through the experience of the founder or foundress.\\xe2\\x80\\x99By this is not meant that the privations or sufferings of the founder--the more dramatic ele-ments of his/her life--need be reproduced in some sort of role playing. Indeed, the point is the reproduction of the insight and inspiration of the founding charism itself. What elements of the Christian experience brought about the development that the religious knows as his/her spiritual legacy? How were the evangelical counsels and the gospel message ex-perienced by the founder in such a way that the foundation of this group became a means of incarnating these values? If the congregation is the incarnation of the values of the founder--an extension of his/her charism into history--how is it to be experienced, personally by the members and corporately by the community as a whole? The questions above zero in on the issues that the directed retreat can deal with, in terms of the founding charism of a congregation. What is ob-vious, then, is that the design of the retreat must be developmental, and that might well be, as stated above, quite different from the design used to teach the ideas of the charism, or to study them. Critical Elements of a Founding Charism What, then, are the elements of a founding charism that must be con-sidered in designing such a retreat experience? The Spiritual Exercises are a brilliant example and deserve to be studied, even by those whose spiritual tradition differs sharply from that of the Jesuits. The themes, from the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Two Standards\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to the last consideration, are highly developmental. Each builds on what precedes, not so much intellectually, but in the context of faith. It is possible to find all the elements of the Christian life from conversion Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / 261 to union with God. In short, a spiritual path is described. At the same time, the style of the retreat is congruent with the highly personal emphasis on decision and discernment. The Ignatian directed retreat is characterized (usually, although there are exceptions) by lone meditation, usually at some length, by minimal communal aspects, and by minimal liturgical life. The focus is on the individual coming to grips with his/her personal relationships with the Lord, with an acceptance of that Lordship in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, and in the development of a prayer life that nourishes and defines that relationship. What then are the elements of a founding charism that are critical to the development of directed prayer in this ~evelopmental sense? Four ele-ments surface in any investigation of this question: method of prayer, ascetical and/or devotional practices, a spiritual system, and theological concepts. These are the elements that the designer of the retreat prayer experiences needs to coordinate. The study that makes this possible should be on the part of the retreat director, and the retreatant should not be called o\\xe2\\x80\\x99n to do other than move immediately into the prayer experience. .Let us, then, briefly look at each of these elements of the founding charism in turn. Method of Prayer The first critical question is whether the founder taught a method of prayer, particularly a method of meditation. In many cases, what will be discovered is that the founder/foundress did .use a currently popular method of meditation, but that it was a matter of convenience in instruct-ing novices, and not an important element of the spirituality of the con-gregation. Here some communal discernment is necessary. In reading the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letters of direction, for example, or instructions on prayer, it is necessary to discover the significance of any proper method to the totality of his/her founding charism. If a distinct approach, emphasis, or technique is present, it should be integrated in the directed prayer of the retreat experience, For instance, a congregation consecrated to Mary might well have developed a receptive approach to prayer based on an understanding of Our Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiat, a disposition of total availabi!ity to the Lord. It would hardly be congruent in such a case to suggest.an aggressive, intellectual type of mental prayer. It would surely conflict with many of the themes that the founding charism will c6ntain. Ascetical and/or Devotional Practices This area, like the last, deserves careful work to determine the con-tinuing value of the ascetical and/.or devotional practices of the founder. Things which are merely characteristic of the nationality or culture of the founder may be safely set aside, and tangential devotions may also be ex-cluded. After all, even founders and foundresses are entitled to devotional 262 / Review 1or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 expressions which are uniquely personal, and without having these pro-jected onto their religious foundations! In what sense is the devotion in-volved in the direction that the founder gave his/her early members? What is its theological content? A founder or foundress with a great de-votion to the cross, who writes and speaks of the cross in such a way that it permeates the spirituality of the order, is teaching something of greater import than a founder with a great personal devotion to a. patron saint or to a shrine. Similarly, the practice of taking names in religion may have been merely the religious convention of the time of foundation, or it may have had specific meaning~ Other ascetical practices are.to be similarly evalu-ated. In one tradition, the regulations of the founder about the diet may have been a simple indication of poverty within his .cultural context\\\\\", \\\\\"in another tradition, the manner in which the question is treated might indi-cate that the retreat should include some fasting, if possible, and with cerr tain goals in mind. A Spiritual System The most obvious element is the spiritual system of the foundation. Did the founder have an approach to spirituality which he taught to the early members? What virtues did he consider important, especially, what aspects of the Christian life did he consider characteristic of his founda-tion? What were his interpretation and understanding of evangelical chastity, poverty, and obedience, and did this differ from the prevailing understand-ings of his time? Did the foundation include any other vows besides the three traditional ones, even though these may no longer exist in the con-gregation? What was the value that the founder/foundress was stressing by having additional vows? What was his/her notion of common life and community experience? What is the role of the apostolate in fostering the spiritual life? All these are part of the questions that must be asked in the process of constructing the spiritual system of the founder or foundress, as, usually in most cases, active founders have not written out the spiritual system in clear fashion. Besides exploring the documents of the congregation, however, the living experience of the early foundation is itself of importance. The story of the life of the founder is often of great value in determining what he meant by a certain teaching. Religious orders are, after all, not only com-munities, but a special modality of community--witness communities that show forth the transcendent dimension of Christian life. The witness of the early foundation, therefore, is of great importance as a form of teach-ing. Theological Concepts Usually, theological concepts do not appear in a founding charism as Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / 263 such. Founders and foundresses are rarely interested in theology except as it reveals the person :of Jesus Or underlies a religious value. Nevertheless, founders are usually very concerned about fidelity to the deposit of faith. A renewed understanding of theological concepts in recent years may make it possible to enrich the understanding of the founder. The founding charism does not really change, but the religious order is called to fidelity to it, not to literal acceptance in the language, cultural norms, and symbols of the early society. As the Church grows in its understanding, of herself and her divine mission, so \\xe2\\x80\\x99a religious congregation should show signs of growth in its self-understanding.\\xe2\\x80\\x99To utilize a theological concept such as the Eucharist without integrating the better insights coming from a renewed liturgy of celebration would be more than unfortunate. It would be .a denial of the fidelity\\xe2\\x80\\x99of the founder to the Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teaching, because as he was faithful to ~the Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expression of eternal truth in his time and culture, so the congregation, today must reproduce that fidelity. Again, renewed Biblical scholarship has made possible far greater sophistication in understanding the gospel message than heretofore. That cannot be ignored in studying the founding charism, merely because it has happened since the founder died! The \\xc2\\xb0emphasis laid upon the experiential above is not to be interpreted as demeaning the importance of the intellectual as preparation for prayer. Anti-intellectualism is not a mark of the Christian, Quite the contrary, and the directed prayer experience will be the richer for the .hours spent by both ~director and retreatant in studying the basic teaching ,of the Church, especially in those areas that touch upon the founding charism. ~Fhe Retreat ~s Reflection of the Founding Charism The first of the elements of a founding charism was stated as the method of meditation or mental prayer. The idea of the importance of the ,congruence of this with~the total spirituality of the founder or foundress was stressed, but this idea can also be expanded~. The entire style of the directed retreat should reflect the founding.charism. The import/race of this cannot easily be exaggerated because of ~he\\xe2\\x80\\x99experiential nature of:the directed retreat. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a profound difference between the directed re-treat., as desert experien.ce (silence, lone meditation at great length, and so forth) and the directed retreat as communal\\xe2\\x80\\x99,experience (common liturgi-cal celebrations,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 some group discussion, and so forth). In among these contrasts are many modalities of directed retreat, of course. The point is that it is important to include those aspects which will most effectively help the retreatant to gro~w into the values which are the subjects of the prayer experiences. The spirituality that emphasizes a deeply communitarian-or service value will not come through successfully in a desert experience. This i~ not to say that the desert experience is not of value for religious f~\\xe2\\x80\\x99om adtive commui~ities~(far from it!), but only that a limited aspect of their spirituality is likqly to emerge in such a context. Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 Similarly, methods of discernment should be congruent with the found-ing charism itself. What was the method for discerning the will of God used by the founder or foundress? Was it a communal means, or one based on authority? Discernment itself has become an issue, both within the directed retreat movement and in other contexts? It is an integral part of the Spiritual Exercises, and would seem to be an integral part of the work of the director of prayer. Within a given tradition, the method of dis-cernment might well be prophetic or charismatic. More likely it will reflect an authoritarian tone, which would translate into the directed retreat as a form of obedience to the spiritual guide. This type of obedience itself needs to be understood, as it isnot the same as the obedience owed a superior under the evangelical vow. In some traditions, the means of discernment might be very communal, in such a way that group direction might be a compatible style for certain congregations using the directed retreat. This would be alongside the pri-vate interview, which is essential to the directed retreat. A final word should be added on the place of resolutions. Many re-ligious feel strongly that they should come home from retreat with clear resolutions for the future--a battle plan, so to speak. The presumption is so strong with many that it is an issue that should be frankly discussed with the director. It is certainly not necessary for the directed retreat\\\\\", \\\\\"it is enough that there be an interior renewal and deepened commitment to the spirit of the foundation. Whether there are \\\\\\\\\\\\\"results\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or decisions on con-crete action for the future should flow from the needs of the person him-self/ herself. Too often it is merely another expression of a workaholic personality. Conclusion This has been a simple and sketchy view of the development of a directed retreat from the point of view of the goal of growth in the spirit of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own order. As such, directed prayer is a powerful means of growth toward incarnating in oneself the values of the founding charism. It is a means of renewal that not only affirms one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to religious life, but also goes far toward building and renewing the community through renewed religious, standing firmly in the tradition of the one who brought the order into being under God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace. 8Criticism has been recently expressed by W.

Discernment Today In our attempts to seek and find God in our lives and to live out our Chris-tian lives of faith, hope, and love, we are often involved in a process of rediscovery. There is not that much that is new for us in the sense of dis-covering something for the first time. But often the conditions of the times in which we live and our own felt needs combine to lead us to focus on a particular aspect of the spiritual life. Such, I would suggest, is the case in the area of discernment. It is certainly a term that has deep roots in the history of Christian spirituality. But ours is a period that has seized upon the process of discernment--perhaps too quickly and too glibly at times-- in the hopes that it might aid us in our efforts to love and serve God both as individuals and as communities, and to seek and respond more gener-ously to His will in our lives. This renewed interest in discernment should come as no surprise. First of all, there is the very visible desire of many to deepen their own union with God, to establish or reestablish what they consider the essentials and priorities in their lives, and to make any required decisions in a context of faith and prayer. In a time of great change, many are seeking to find strength and unity within themselves not only to cope effectively with their lives and all their responsibilities, but also. to maintain themselves as lov-ing and productive persons. Secondly, many communities are turning to the process of discernment as a method of helping them in their attempts at renewal as a community and as a basis for group decisions. But whether 265 266 / Review for Religious, ~olume 33, 197.4/2 it is a case of individual discernment or corporate discernment, it is impor-tant to stress over and over that the basis of any discernment has to be the deep and intense prayer of the persons involved in the process. The context of any true discernment is prayer. The purpose of this article, then, is to offer some reflections on discernment, using the word in the broadest sense here and focusing on the intimate connection between discernment and prayer. ontex! Is Prayer Discernment really makes sense only when it is situated in the context of prayer. Unless there is a corresponding desire to seek and find God continually in our lives and to deepen our awareness of His reality and presence, discernment can end up just being talk. The seeking and yearn-ing attitude of the Psalmist must penetrate our own lives deeply: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"To you, my heart speaks\\\\\", \\\\\"you my glance seeks, your presence, O Lord, I seek. Hide not your face from me\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ps 27:8-9). There is, of course, a renewed in-terest and even a hunger on the part of many today in the area of per-sonal prayer\\\\\", \\\\\"and this accounts in part for the renewed interest in the area of discernment. There are many indications of this all around us at the present time\\\\\", \\\\\"and many are definitely expressing a desire for praye~r which springs from a felt human need and the presence of the Spirit in our midst, ever renewing, ever arousing. Recently I was listening to a taped conference on prayer by Thomas Merton in which he mentioned at the beginning that he ~did not like to talk a great deal about prayer. This was certainly not from any disinterest, for if there is any constant preoccupation and interest that emerges in his life and writings, it would be with the value and priority he constantly gives to prayer. But he wanted to stress the point that pr~yer for us should be something simple and natural, something as simple and natiaral as breath-ing. It is hard for us to talk about breathing since it is such a normal process of our lives and one wfiich we can easily take for granted. So, too, he feels should be the case with prayer. At times we can complicate it and make an issue or a cause out of it. But usually when we make a~ca~]se or an issue out of something, we oppose it to something else: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is.prayer, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. This is something sacred, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The f~us could then shift to the issue rather than the reality, and prayer could then be viewed as something complicated and artificial. Perhaps we can best consider prayer as the simple, natural, continual response of one who is,. convinced he be-longs to God and seeks to grow in union with Him, and the response of one who realizes he is a person possessed by a loving God. And it is in this climate, this atmosphere of prayer tl~at the whole process of discern-ment should be placed. The context is a very normal, full, and serious seek-ing after God. Pray\\xe2\\x80\\x99~r.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Context o[ Discernment / 267 The Process of Discernment \\xe2\\x80\\x99 Discernment, then, should not be considered a cause or an issue nor ev~en\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a method in itself. It is a process in prayer by which one seeks seri-ously to know and follow God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will, to hear His call and faithfully and generously respond in the very real life situation of the person concerned. If l~ra~er should be a very human and ordinary experience, so too should b6 discernment. In this sense, it is a very simple process\\\\\", \\\\\"and yet, on the other hand, it can be difficult in the sense that it presupposes constant efforts at\\xe2\\x80\\x99a deep and continuous union with God through prayer. This re-quires perseverance, patience, and willingness to expend time and energy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cannot be turned off and on like a water faucet if it is to be effective\\\\\", \\\\\"it presupposes a firm basis of faith and the continuous seeking of the presence of the Lord. ~Alth0ugh discernment is a word that can come easily to the lips, it can still remain a rather elusive concept. Perhaps this is because it pre-soppos~ so much else. At any rate, we might recall Father Futrellrs defi-nition that discernment \\\\\\\\\\\\\"involves choosing the way of the light of Christ instead of the way of the darkness of the Evil One and living out the con-sequences of this choice through discerning what specific decisions and ac-tions a~e, demanded to follow Christ here and now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 Thus discernment focuses on the ongoing attempts to clarify and ascertain God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will in our lives and seeks to specify what actions and decisions are required in the life of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"on\\xe2\\x80\\x99e who wishes to follow Christ tothlly. The process presupposes an int\\xe2\\x80\\x99eflse desire, hunger, and willingness to seek God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will and to embrace it generously once one has come to a reasonable certitude regarding it. W~ might say it all comes down to our attempts to hear and respond to:the wo~\\xe2\\x80\\x99d of God in our own unique lives. But. if we are to be sensitive t~lGod speaking to us in the many ways He does.in our liv6s, we must first hear His call\\\\\", \\\\\"we must listen quietly and give Him frequent opportuni-ties to speak to us. If we fire to b~ sensitive to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and attentive to His touch, there must be an element of stillness and listening. Since this listening~aspect is so important for discernment, we should not be surprised to find this aspect of prayer being re-e~mphasized today.2 Many are ex-periencing the need today to.. take time out from all their activities in order to turn within and seek God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence within, to contemplate Him and to listen to Him in the stillness of their hearts. It is a kind of active receptivity as we let the radical truth of God shine forth with its own life within us. We seek to make the words of the P~almist our own: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"In your light we see light.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is in this atmosphere .of stillness and presence that one can best determine God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s touch, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will. ~John C. Futrell, S.J., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ignatian Discernment,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Studies in the Spirituality o] Jesuits, v. 2, no. 2, p. 47. \\xe2\\x80\\x99-\\xe2\\x80\\x99See, for example, W. Norris Clarke, S.J., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Be Still and Contemplate,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"~ New Catholic World, November-December 1972, pp. 246 ft. 2611 / Review [or Religious, l/\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 1974/2 Building on the Past As we seek to see clearly where God is touching us at a given time and where He is leading us and asking us to respond and follow, it is very help-ful to grow in the awareness of where God has touched us and nourished us0 in the past. Each of us has his or her own unique history in the hands of a loving God, that is, significant events, persons, books, Scripture pas-sages, and so forth, that have been a source of great strength and help. All of this constitutes our own faith experience of God\\\\\", \\\\\"and the more it is brought to our conscious awareness, the more it becomes our own. Often in discernment workshops or faith sharing experiences, methods and oppor-tunities are presented to help individuals grasp more explicitly what they uniquely possess of God in their lives. One can call this by various names: one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core experience of God, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beauty within, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name of grace, and so forth. But it all comes down to the same reality: we seek to realize what we already possess, what is uniquely ours, and where God has touched us and loved us significantly. Once we are more aware of how God has acted in our lives in the past, we can more easily return in a spirit of prayer to be nourished and strengthened and sustained. What has sustained us in ~the past and what has touched us before, can sustain us and touch us again. This conscious awareness also helps us to be more responsive and sensitive to where God is touching us now, where He is leading us. We can begin to see a pattern and a continuity in our lives of faith. Above all, we be-come more aware of the profoundest reality of our lives, namely that which we possess of the power and love of God that has worked within us in the past and continues to be operative in the present. Discernment in prayer, then, is an ongoing process that seeks to find God and His will in our lives\\\\\", \\\\\"it involves a constant seeking of God and an awaren(ss of His presence in our lives. Through discernment one seeks to hear God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuous call, to recognize it as clearly as possible in order to follow it as faithfully and generously as possible. It seeks to answer the question: How can I best love and serve God in the present circumstances of my life. It is an ongoing process because our lives, our experience, our work, our relationship with God is an ongoing process. His Word does not come to us in a vacuum but in the concrete circumstances of our everyday lives. As Thomas Merton says in one of my favorite passages from his writings: Every moment and every event of every man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life on earth plants some-thing in his soul. For just as the wind carries thousands of winged seeds, so each moment brings with it germs of spiritual vitality that come to rest im-perceptibly in the minds and wills of men. Most of these unnumbered seeds perish and are lost, because men are not prepared to receive them\\\\\", \\\\\"for such seeds as these cannot spring up anywhere except in the good soil of freedom and love.3 aThomas Merton, New Seeds of Contemplation (New York: New Directions, 1961), p. 14. Prayer: The Context of Discernment / 269 In a very true sense, it is only the faith-filled person, the contemplating person that is acutely sensitive to these seeds of God in his or her life. And for the soil of freedom and love to flourish in our own lives, we must con-stantly open ourselves to the Spirit of God through an abiding spirit of prayer. Not only must we seek to grow sensitive to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speaking to us in the external events of our lives, but we must seek to grow in an awareness and sensitivity to the movements within ourselves as we react personally to the signs of His will and presence. How do my present reactions corre-spond to the felt experience of God that has been so much a part of my life in the past? Are my present movements in resonance with that source of peace, that sense of oneness and wholeness before God that I have ex-perienced before, that sense of belonging to God that has been so nourish-ing and sustaining in my life? Are they consistent with the normal signs of the Spirit working within us, the signs of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility and self-control\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Gal. 5:22-3)? These are some of the questions one seeks to clarify in order to fulfill the desire to seek and find the Lord and His will. The spiritual director can play an important role in assisting here, for at times we can be too close to ourselves to have the needed objectivity. The director can aid us in clarifying and objectifying our own experiences and interior movements and aid us to see where God is touching us, loving us, and indicating His presence and His will. A Sense of Freedom In addition to a deep and constant spirit of prayer, discernment also requires an attitude of freedom and detachment. The attitude of freedom I refer to is that which allows a person to give to God and His will the central place in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life\\\\\", \\\\\", it is a freedom and detachment from all other things that would either prevent or hinder one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s striving to focus On God. It is the sense of freedom that allows God to become and remain the cen-tral reality in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. The Psalmist speaks of this centrality with the words: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"As the eyes of the servant are on the hands of the Master, so my eyes are on you, O Lord.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is the freedom that allows one to respond generously to Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 invitation to Matthew, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Come, follow me,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and His words to the disciples of John the Baptist, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Come and see.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Come and see and taste the goodness of the Lord. It is the freedom expressed in the words of the prophet Samuel, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (1 Sam 3:10), and the words of the Psalmist, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Here am I, Lord, I come to do your will\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ps 40:7-8). We might note in passing that there can be an intimate connection between this spirit of freedom and a lifestyle that is marked by a spirit of simplicity. How does one grow in this spirit of freedom? Ultimately it is through a cooperation with the power of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace and love working within us. 270 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 But one important way is through a deepening realization that one is a loved sinner, that one has been touched and healed. A profound convic-tion of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steadfast love and fidelity can be a very liberating force that enables one to turn to God and seek Him alone and His service in a spirit of simplicity and joy. This freedom grows in a context of lively faith and is nourished in prayerful reflection on God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goodness, mercy, love, and providence. Conclusion In general, discernment in prayer is an inward looking process\\\\\", \\\\\"the focus is mainly on the movements and experiences of God within us. But the process must never stop here for there should also be an outward dimension of discernment. First of all, as in so many areas of the spiritual life of man, a healthy norm is: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"By their fruits you shall know them.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" There is a confirmatory aspect of all discernment in the external fruits that are in evidence and the good works that are produced. Secondly, the great commandment,of love must always be kept in perspective, and a deepening union with God should lead to a deepening union with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fellow man. An increasing sense of compassion for one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fellow man and his needs should flow from one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s union with God. Finally, the process should lead to an increasing sensitivity to life and all its mysteries, to an increasing awareness of.God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence in all things, and to our own growth as-con-templatives in action.

That way,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she answered with a bold sweep of the arm as her hand pointed up a dark rise of conifers. I turned in the opposite direction to the friendly lights of an inn. It was a good choice. There among the youths gathered around the blazing fire was Jan. A couple years earlier he had been up to see the hermit with his pastor. He offered to be my guide. Good to his word, Jan arrived early the next morning with his little Volkswagen which took us as far as it could. Then we began to climb on foot. I was a bit embarrassed when Jan took my bag, but soon I was very grateful that he had--for otherwise I probably would never have made it. We must have climbed steadily, along an old logging trail, for forty-five minutes or more when Jan sudde.nly stopped and pointed back into the woods. We had actually passed our goal: Maria Einscete--Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hermit-age. Maria Einscete was just a simple log cabin, one just like so many others in those forests. Larid in Norway belongs to the owner by hereditary right. It cannot be \\\\\\\\\\\\\"definitively alienated. Most families living in the villages or on the lowland farms own stretches of woodland up on the mountains. 272 / Review ]or Religious, l,\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 197/.\\xe2\\x80\\x99-/2 In better times they kept men up there ,to care for the woods, but now most of these lumberjack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabins are empty. One of these landlords, a kindly man, let Brother Robert use his abandoned cabin, plant some vege-tables, and dig a well. From the United States to Chile and to Norway Brother Robert, Father Robert Kevin Anderson, is a monk of St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Abbey, Spencer, Massachusetts. He entered the Cistercian Order at the Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley back in 1949 when he was 17. He was one of the first choir novices professed after the community trans-ferred to Spencer. Frater Kevin, as he was called in those days, cared for the newly planted orchards and, after his ordination to the priesthood, for the newly planted brothers--as father master of the lay novices. But he had always experienced an attraction toward a more simple and radical form of monasticism. He went on to pursue this, first at St. Benedict\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monastery in the Colorado Rockies, then at the Monastery of Las Condes in the Chilean Andes. It was at the latter monastery that he first embarked on the eremitical life which he found to be his true calling. Later Father Robert sought deeper solitude in southern Chile\\\\\", \\\\\"but the bishop there had some ideas of his own about how Father was to lead the eremitical life. So Father moved on to the land of his family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s origins, Sweden. Here again, a hard-pressed bishop with few priests had his own ideas how a hermit-priest should live. And again Father moved, this time across the border to the diocese of the sympathetic and understanding Cistercian bishop, John Gran of Oslo. Until he could find a suitable site, Father Robert lived in a distant parish. Soon he found what seemed like an ideal place for a hermit: an island on Lake Tinn. But appearances can be deceiving. Living on an island meant dependence on others for all supplies, or keeping a boat for summer and an ice sleigh for winter. Then, too, the fine summer weather brought traffic to the lake. Father lifted up his eyes to the mountains, and soon ascended to Maria Einscete. The Hermit Life o| Father Robert Although feature articles and TV presentations have made Father Robert known throughout Norway and even throughout Scandinavia, he yet receives few visitors. The Norwegians respect and are inspired by his life of prayer and presence to God. They do not want to intrude. Besides, the ascent is difficult and the way known to few. The Catholic pastor, whose parish extends for several hundred miles, calls in from time to time. And of course, the good sisters find their way there at times\\\\\", \\\\\"also, the search-ing young--from as far away as south France or America. Priests have occasionally come for retreat. And a pious convert lives not far from Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mailbox and enjoys having him in to say Mass in her front room. A Norwegian Outpost: Maria Einscete / 273 But usually Bror Robert (as the Norwegians call him) is alone with his goats and his God. He goes down to the road to the mailbox every few days--and the owner of the neighboring box watches to see that the mail is collected, a sign that all is well with their hermit. Once a week or so, on skis in winter and a motor bike in summer, Father will go to the village for supplies. All the villagers know and love their hermit. They expressed real joy when \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Robert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother\\\\\\\\\\\\\" came to visit him. From time to time Father goes to Oslo to speak to the Dominican nuns, the only con-templative community in Norway. And once a year he goes south to the French Abbey of Mont-des-Cats to see his spiritual father. This was one of the conditions the bishop placed on his presence in the diocese as a hermit: that once a year he would spend some time in a monastery. Father Robert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life is very simple. He prays the hours quite as they always have been celebrated in the monastery, and offers Mass for all man-kind. He does some wood carving, mounts ikons, and practices the ancient Norwegian craft of weaving baskets from birch roots. He also translates books. He is a gifted linguist and has mastered both new and old Nor-wegian, as well as the local dialect. These occupations, along with Mass stipends, help him to keep body and soul together. At the time of my first visit Father Robert had been living in his log cabin for about a year. The only facilities were the woods. He had dug a well nearby and so had plenty of good water. But he confessed to me that he spent most of his time during that first winter chopping firewood--for his cabin had no inner walls and was very difficult to heat. The Spencer community helped him then to get a logger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caravan, which is not only much more snug and easier to heat, but which Father was able to locate higher up on the mountain where he can benefit from much more sunshine. The view from the new location, looking out across Lake Tinn to Mount Gaustaf, one of the highest peaks in southern Norway, is simply magnifi-cent. As the rays of the sun play on clouds, mountains, lake, and forest one is ceaselessly awed. This is indeed a Godly place--an ideal place for a hermit. The Monastic Presence of Father Robert This extension of Spencer Abbey and of the American Cistercian Re--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gion, this foothold of Cistercian life in Norway, is certainly something for which we should be most grateful and praise the Lord. The effectiveness of Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monastic presence cannot be fully evalu-ated but it is certainly significant. This is rather surprising in a country where most are at best nominal members of a state church, and the few, very scattered Catholics tax the handful of devouted priests and religious who seek to minister to them. The latter, without exception, seemed to ad-mire and respect Father and find inspiration in his fidelity to his particular calling. But the Lutherans, too, revere him and seem to be grateful and 274 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 happy .that this man of God is in their midst. They relate stories of her-mits and monks who lived in this land before the Reformation and the Danish oppression, even of a particular hermit in the area of Lake Tinn. Even for these apparently religiously indifferent, ,the man of prayer living alone on the mountain is a sign of hope, of something better, higher, tran-scendent. And when the final option comes, hopefully, with perhaps only a vague and confused idea of what he stands for in their minds, and the grace flowing from his prayer in their hearts, they will reach out for that Transcendent Reality. Blessed be the Lord God . . . he has raised up a horn of salvation for Norway. Now that there is a Cistercian bishop and hermit, in Norway may we not soon have a regular cenobitic foundation? It is time the Cistercians returned. The Cistercians first directed their steps to Norway back in the twelfth century, in the Golden Age of the Order. And there are still significant remains ~of their presence. On the Island of HoevedCya in the Oslo Fjord, just a short ferryboat ride from the capital, are the ruins of an abbey founded in 1147 from Kirkstall,. The whole outiine of the regular build-ings is there. The walls of .the church reach up ten and fifteen feet, and higher at the comer tower. Through the insisterice of \\xe2\\x80\\x99Bishop Gran the government now preserves this site as a national monument. It is a very beautiful site indeed. But historical sites, no matter how beautiful, are not enough. The Church of Norway, like every other, needs for its fullness the presence of living and thriving contemplative communities. Guided by the Lord, Brother Robert has made a beginning. May the Lord prosper what he has begun. Reflections on Bangalore Sister Mary-John Mananzan, O.S.B. From October 14-22, 1973, the Second Asian Monastic Congress was held in Banga-lore, India. Sister Mary-John Mananzan, O.S.B., attended the meeting and gives here her impressions of the Congress. Sister Mary-John is Dean\\\\\", \\\\\"St. Scholastica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s College\\\\\", \\\\\"P.O. Box 3153\\\\\", \\\\\"Manila, Philippines. This will not be a report on the Bangalore Congress in the usual sense, but rather a reliving of significant experiences and a sharing of insights gained. No amount of faithful reporting can capture the atmosphere of such a meeting. But .perhaps the sharing of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impressions can give a glimpse into the dynamics of the ievent much more than a complete but detached description 9f the proceedings. Personalities Let me begin with the significant people who made an impression on me. Among the observers to the Congress were two Tibetan monks who rePr, ds.ehted thee Dalai Lama. They were Lama Sherpa Tulku and Lama Samdong Tulku. The one word that ke\\xe2\\x80\\x99eps coming to my mind to describe them is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"genuine.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I was struck by their authenticity, their trueness to them-selves, their utter lack of pretense. They went about with serene dignity, quiet friendliness~ and unfailing self-mast6ry. They talked with perfect frankness about the problems of their people in exile with feeling but with-out the slightest rancor againsl~ the invading Chinese. And with disarming simplicity, one of them asked in our small group discussions: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Please ex-plain to us what you mean by a personal God.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The theological jar~gon did not seem to satisfy them, so during the coffee break I ventured an explana-tion which ran something like this: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lama Sherpa, do you sometimes talk to the Absolute Reality?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 275 276 / Review [or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he replied. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do you think he understands you?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Well, that is more or less what we mean when we say that God is a person.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He seemed to be more satisfied with this explanation. The lamas had a way of expressing their ideas in an unusually effective way. During the discussion on prayer Lama Samdong Tulku made the following remark: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"I.got the impression that when you pray, you send your words to the Absolute Reality. We, we push ourselves to It.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Another personality which, for me, stood out, was Abbot Primate Rem-bert Weakland himself. He was a most excellent presiding officer\\\\\", \\\\\"more-over, his introductory and concluding talks showed his keen intelligence, his versatile scholarship, and his sobriety of judgment. He was most human. He joked with the seminarians of the Kristu Jyoti College where we stayed as though he were one of them but without losing his dignity. In fact I ob-served in him something I seldom observe in many superiors today--an unembarrassdd awareness of his authority and an unapologetic reference to it when he considered it useful to do so. Among the non-Asians who had adopted the Eastern way of monastic life, the one I considered most credible was Father Bede Griffiths. He went about in a most unobtrusive, unostentatious way without the slightest effort to edify or to preach. I find this significant because I felt that there can be a tendency among non-Asians who have insights about the indigenization of monastic life and liturgy which are in themselves authentic, to be over-zealous and therefore tactless in their efforts to conscienticize the people whose culture they have studied and adopted. I believe that there can be a very naive, uncritical adaptation to indigenous culture which, if cohpled with a lack of delicacy in strategy, could alienate the people because it ap-pears to them to be another and a subtler form of paternalism. When this is further accompanied by efforts to edify, then the people are positively repelled. Then one provokes reactions which may sound extreme and de-fensive, but are not wholly unjustified like: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why do they give themselves to be more Eastern than the Easterns?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The adaptation of the Eastern forms of monasticism by monks and nuns in Asia is an important venture\\\\\", \\\\\"but this must be undertaken with utmost delicacy, tactful strategy, and with what perhaps for Westerners will amount to an almost intolerable amount of patience. I was enriched by the friendship with Vietnamese monks and nuns who shared with me their spiritual adventures. They have left their b!g monas-teries in the hillsides and have come to live among the poor in the center of the city of Saigon. The nuns take in laundry and typing work to support themselves and the monks take turns in tricycle driving. Reflections on Bangalore / 277 The Theme of the Congress The theme of the Congress was: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Experience of God.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This was divided into subtopics .such as: Monastic Experience of God in Christianity and Other Religions\\\\\", \\\\\"The Experience of God: Methods of Realization\\\\\", \\\\\"The Experience of God in Community Life\\\\\", \\\\\"The Influence of Asiatic Religious on Monastic Structure\\\\\", \\\\\"The Experience of God and Social Responsibility\\\\\", \\\\\"and The Contribution of Christian Monasticism of Asia to the Universal Church. These were discussed in small groups as well as in the general assemblies. Again I will not make an effort to summarize the discussions but rather pick out those which had an impact on me. First of all, I regained my respect for the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"monastic.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Due to certain historical factors, the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"monastic\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in certain circles had come to mean deportment, a pattern of behavior and a fuga mundi attitude. In the Congress, the main emphasis was on the single-minded search for God. There is a monastic dimension to every human being. For those who have come to an awareness orbit and who wish to fulfill this dimension of their being, there should be monastic communities whose structures are flexible enough to share their way of life even on a temporary basis. At this point, it is good to mention.what Bishop D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Souza expressed as the petition of the Indian hierarchy. The Indian hierarchy, he said, is asking the monastic communities to be: 1. eschatological signs (monks and nuns should primarily be men and women of God) 2. centers of liturgy 3. havens of serenity 4. examples Of simplicity of life and refinement 5. model communities for Christian living 6. houses of undiscriminating hospitality One thing that was realized in the Congress was the contribution that the non-Christian form of monasticism can give to the traditional Christian monastic\\\\\\\\\\\\\" life. There are several elements of the Eastern form of monasti-cism which have been forgotten or not emphasized enough in the Western tradition. There is, for example, the importance of the techniques and meth-ods in the search for the Absolute. The role of the body in prayer that is very much emphasized in Yoga and Zen could\\xe2\\x80\\x99be given the same impor-tance by Christian monks and nuns. The existential view of the Absolute and the unified view of reality of the East could balance the more con-ceptual and dualistic view of the West. The importance of the guru in Eastern spirituality can likewise revitalize the role of the spiritual director. Father Raymond Pannikar summarizes the unique role of the East thus: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Just as Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to the Church is sensitivity to creation and that of the West,. the discovery of the value of history\\\\\", \\\\\"so the unique con-tribution of the Asian is to develop the dimension o] the spirit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 278 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 Shared Prayer The Congress was not just a series of intellectual discugsions on the experience of God: It was for many participants something of a spiritual experience in itself. Contributing tO these was, first, the shared liturgy which the different regional groups prepared, giving the ~vhole community an ex-perience of a variety of. indigenous liturgy \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese. There were likewise opportunities to meditate in the, Zen\\xe2\\x80\\x99 way, the Yoga way, the Tibetan Buddhist way, and in Christian shared prayers. Amid the variety of methods, ceremonies, symbols, \\xc2\\xb0and gestures there was the unity of hearts in worship.~And then there were the interpersonal en-counters which occasioned the sharing of spiritual experiences, the creating oLbonds which gave the promise of lasting friendships.~There was thus the wonder of discovery of the other in each other. There were no resolutions, conclusions, or statements at the end of the Congress. As Father Abbot Primate said, Bangalore was more humble in its tone than the Bangkok Congress. Its open-endedness is a challenge to further reflection and to further action. And this challenge was expressed in the delegates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 message to their communities which reads as follows: Message to Our Communities Together with Father Abbot Primate, Rembert Weakland, we, , gathered here at Bangalore for the Second Asian Monastic Congress, salute you with an Indian greeting:which echoes in our liturgy, SHANTI, PEACEF ,~ We would like to share with you the atmosphere of joy, openness and fraternity that prevails in this community, which grow out of peoples of dif-ferent backgrounds, not only of race and culture, but also of religious tradi-tion. We are fortunate to have at our meeting Cl~ri~tia\\xe2\\x80\\x99n monks and sisters of various countries, Tibetan lamas, Buddhist and Jain mdnks and Hindu swamis and sanyasis. We lived together, \\xe2\\x80\\x99praying and discussing in mutual enrichment. We are amazed to realize that, amid very real differences of opinions and experiences, there is an overwhelming convergence of concern: THE SINGLEMINDED SEARCH FOR GOD. It is in this conce.rn ~that we experience a strong bond of unity. We consider it our task as monks to commit ourselves wholehea.rtedly to this search, and it is in this context that we accept the world around us and feel h sense o.f sol!darity with it. We have a role in bt~iiding up the city of man. This consigts in pointing out to man the path to God. In particular, we are to share with the poor in theii-\\xc2\\xb0striving for human dignity and liberty. It has become clear to us that to realise these goals i.n our times calls for a radical openness.and flexibility in our religious life and structures. We are in a moment of challenge. If we fail to respond, we lose our right to exigt as monasteries. Your delegates will bring home to:you reports of the proceedihgs of the Congress. Understandably, these will kive but a glimpse into what really happened here. But, for many of us, this Congress has been a: real spiritual experience. ,.Your delegates can communicate this experience more effectively than any written .report. It is our earnest prayer that all the communities scattered throughout Asia will put into effect the insights gained during this Congress.. Tliis may mean breaking away from fixed patterns, settink out like Abraham ihto ff new land. Reflecffon~ on Bangalore / 279 We strongly recommend openness to our brothers of other religious traditions who, as we have experienced here, have so much to offer us. We urge the rethinking of our way of life so that as many people as possible may have the opportunity of sharing with us our experience of God within the content of living and vital communities. Let us maintain the bonds of unity which have been established among us through our delegates. During these days we have thought of you and prayed for you. May our continued unity in prayer be fostered by renewed contacts with one another. Toward a More Authentic Sharing in Community Laurent Boisvert, O.F.M. Father Laurent Boisvert, O.F.M., is the editor of the excellent Canadian magazine for religious, La vie des corntnunaut~s religieuses and lives at 5750, boulevard Rose-mont\\\\\", \\\\\"Montreal 410, Quebec\\\\\", \\\\\"Canada. The article originally appeared in the March 1973 issue of La vie des communaut~s religieuses and is printed in translation here with the authorization of that magazine. The translation was made by Sister Clarisse Marie, S.N.J.M.\\\\\", \\\\\"General Administration of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary\\\\\", \\\\\"187 Chemin de Cap-St.-Jacques\\\\\", \\\\\"Pierrefonds 940, P.Q.\\\\\", \\\\\"Canada. The sharing of material goods, based on the needs of each individual or moral person, tends to express and intensify the fraternal bond which unites us as religious. However, in everyday living this sharing meets with ob-stacles which compromise, in varying degrees, its fraternal character. A review of them will help us to become more conscious of them and so favor, I hope, the building of that community of justice, peace, and love which all of us desire and which alone can tnaly be called \\\\\\\\\\\\\"fraternal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It is not rare to hear religious ask themselves: How does it happen that our lives are so little changed by the many conferences, sessions, and work-shops in which we participate? These same religious insist that we present them not so much the fundamental values of religious life which they say they already know, but rather a way of integrating them into their lives. The reflections which follow relate to this first step: the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"how\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of living a more genuine fraternal community life, a step which consists in over-coming in oneself the chief obstacles to its realization. False Mental Attitudes When we insist, before community groups, that a distribution of goods 2110 Authentic Sharing in Community / 2111 be made according to the needs of each, some religious express amazement. It seems useless to them that we should come back to so fundamental an issue, and one that everyone accepts. No one can deny, however, that in spite .of acceptance in theory, certain religio.us, and a number sufficiently large to warrant the mentioning of it again, demand for themselves the use of all kinds of things, basing these requests, not on real need, but rather on the fact that other religious have and enjoy the use of. them. If someone has such and such a thing for his work, goes out so many times during the week, or wears clothing of such and such a quality, etc., others use the example of such religious to justify having the same things and acting in like manner. If one group needs two cars, another group made up of the same number of people will perhaps demand one, just because the first group has two, How can we explain this dichotomy between the theory of sharing goods according to need, and the contrary practice illustrated by the examples just given? The reason is, it seems to me, that the criterion for the distribution of goods, recognized at the intellectual level, has not yet penetrated the mentality of all religious nor modified their attitudes and their conduct. Certain religious accept the idea of pluralism in the forms of sharing, but their reactions are those of people accustomed to a uniform type of sharing. They still lack that which, for all of us, is most difficult to realize, namely a change of attitude. No modification of structures, how-ever radical, can dispense a religious from the effort required to bring.about this conversion. It is easier and faster to set up pluralistic structures for sharing than it is to transform a person accustomed to uniformity so that he becomes capable of understanding, of respecting and of favoring diversity on the level of persons and their needs, and of making the necessary applications. All of which helps us to understand that if, in our congregations, the adaptation of structures has in large measure been accomplished, the con-version of our ways of thinking has not. Some years of effort will still be necessary, years of patience and of tolerance, before the transformation of mental attitudes and of conduct becomes a reality. In spite of everything, some people will never know such a transformation, because they believe that such a change is an evil and not a benefit to be pursued. Charity re-quires that we respect them, and that we learn to live with them, in the wis-dom and great-heartedness of compromise which, under its\\xc2\\xb0 positive forms, is love. Inability to Estimate One\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Needs Accurately It is not sufficient to want to share a community of goods according to the real needs of each one. For the actual realization of this principle one must be able to evaluate tfiese needs honestly and accurately. Some religious are more or less incapable of making such an evaluation. For some, the reason lies in the formation they received as young religious and the long 2112 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 practice of a poverty based on dependence. They had only to ask and to leave ,to ,authority to judge the legitimacy of their request. Once the su-perior had given an affirmative answer, they never questioned themselves again about their use of the things granted. -This dependence,, judged in our day excessive, has atrophied the sense of responsibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\"of some and made them quite unable to determine their own needs: Today, when au-thority leaves them free to choose such and such a thing,, to do or not do such and such an. action, to go or not to go to such and such a place, they prefer no action at all rather then assume responsibility for it. Long and difficult will be,the liberating process which will one day enable them to judge their own needs, if~ such will ever be possible. ~ C-Certain religious, coming from poor families and having, lacked some of the basic necessities during their childhood, make up,for lost time and accumulate without reason a surplus of goods. They:even admit that they ask for things to make up for the lack of them experienced in the past..And so they fill their closets with items.for, which they have,no real need, but which give them a sort of psychological security. In this Way they com-pensate for the time when they sutIeredreal want. ~ ,, For other religious, the practice of a poverty consisting of going with-out, of detailed restriction for use\\\\\", \\\\\"of meticulous control and uniformity, has brought ab6ut another ,excessive reaction in that they,are constantly asking ..for things they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need and of which they never .seem to have enough. At the other extreme are those who considered this former practice of poverty the ideal one, and so refuse to accept any form of com-munal sharing based on a pluralism of real needs. Using False Criteria Again, for some religious, the relative incapacity of identifying their real needs results from the use of false criteria. They will say, in, order to justify a trip: all my brothers and,sisters went to such aoplace, though an-other might say~ with just as much truth: I cannot make that .trip since none of my brothers and sisters have ever been there. Can the single fact :that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relatives have visited Europe constitute a ,valid reason for asking for a trip overseas? Or again, can the simple fact that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents have never taken:~some scenic trip within the province or state:~be sufficient reason for denying oneself ,such an outing? In both cases, the use .of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"family\\\\\\\\\\\\\" norm, instead of helping, hinders the discovery of real needs. That one consider the situation of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family is certainly not wrong, but to use it as the sole means of defining orie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Own needs and the ~type of relaxation one has a right to seek is certainly without justification. These .conclusions apply .likewise .to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social and professional posi-tion. There are people who count on the life style of ~this double milieu to determine personal needs. If they: live inca neighborhood where~each family averages one or two color-television~, sets, a summer cottage\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a snowmobile Authentic Sharing in Community / 2113 or~ two, etc., they think that they too have a right to these same things and wi!l use them, under the illusion that they are living their commitment to po~verty.,lf th~ey work in the.~schools or hospitals and if the majority~of their companions go to Florida every year, wear a new outfit every day, etc., they come to believe that such is Lequired of them too, and in their minds these things become necessities that must be satisfied. The fallacy .of such ~rea.soning comes,from the setting up of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s .social or professional sur-roundings as an absolute ~in determining personal needs. It ought to be evi-dent that even if all the teachers of the school have a car, and if all the families in the area have two television sets, I do not necessarily need the same things. It also ha.ppens that this met.hod of evaluating needs ac.cord-ing to a social or professi0nal milieu soon involves various forms of dis-crimination, ail.harmf.ul to .the ,building of a fraternal community. Let us add that economy, valid as it may be, often prejudices one?s judgment of personal needs. To know how to economize is a quality that most people of average means acquire through\\xc2\\xb0 force of circumstances, That religious should possess, it is nother surprising nor embarrassing..\\\\\", \\\\\"Waste-fulness and .extravagance, as well as carelessness, have always been,.con-sidered faults. The error, in the case of the religious, is to purchase things, not because ~one may need them, but because they are on sale and that per-haps one day they will be useful. It is also true that this intention of econo-mizing has a way of multiplying needs. The Influence of Numbers ,, In visiting a number of local commu~nities I ~have ~liscovered that re-ligious in small groups have their real needs satisfied much more easily than do religious in..larger gr.oups: Although not universal, this situation is repre-sentativ, e of a number of congregations. Of course, there are many cases in which it is reasonable and necessary \\xc2\\xaf to take numbers, into consideration. For example, if the local authority in a community of one hundred persons is planning an outing which includes transportation and lunch~ it is obvious that one must consider the number of those who wish to participate. The influence of numbers can, however, become harmful to community sharing when., a particular type .of logic prevails as sometimes happens in larg~ groups, though it. may also be found in more restricted ones, too. For example, two or three religious.desire to obtain skis in order to satisfy.a real need for relaxation, so they go to the local authority with their req.uest only to receive this answer: I cannot authorize such an expenditure\\\\\", \\\\\"just think of the money involved if the sixty religious of the house were to come asking for skis! This reasoning characterizes a mentality which cerl~ainly is not pluralistic ,\\xe2\\x80\\x99and which fails to respect personal needs. That two or three religious desire some skis in no way implies that all the others need or even wish them. The falseness of this reasoning is even more evident Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 when we realize that the community is made up for the most part of older people or of those who are ill. On pushing this kind of logic to the extreme, one ought to refuse a wheelchair to a sick person who really needs one because everyone else might want one too. This type of reasoning may also exist among some members of the community group. They refrain from asking for what they really need be-cause they say: If everybody were to ask for such a thing, the community could not afford it. However, it is nowhere written that all the religious of a house must have the same needs at the same time, and that to satisfy them one must buy sixty canes or sixty wigs at the same time! Why, then, should we suppose this uniformity and always act in view of the total num-ber? Wherever this kind of logic dominates, whether on the part of the superior or of the members of the group matters little, it makes impossible the practice of community sharing according to need. The Moral Weight of Salaries The religious earning a high salary seems to have a special facility for getting what he needs and often more than he needs, while the one who makes no financial contribution is sometimes too embarrassed to make known real needs. Other variants of this phenomenon are these: The re-ligious in a salaried service who works overtime may think it his right to keep and to use as he pleases at least a part of the extra money so earned\\\\\", \\\\\"the one who has won a grant or money award will not fail to exploit his chance of obtaining favors\\\\\", \\\\\"the religious who receives an \\\\\\\\\\\\\"old-age pension\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the one who regularly draws some form of income may also use these to obtain personal advantages. The moral weight of money earned by a religious\\xe2\\x80\\x99 likewise risks in-fluencing the decisions of the superior. Does he feel as free and no more obligated in evaluating the requests of the one who hands in a substantial check than he does in judging those requests made by members who make no such contribution? It would not be surprising if, in the first case, he finds a particular facility in saying \\\\\\\\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\" at once and with a smile, while in the second case, he has a tendency to ask questions about the necessity of the items requested and to multiply his reflections on the observance of poverty. In allowing a lapse of time between turning in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s check and making a request for what one judges useful or necessary, the religious can help those in authority to avoid showing favor and granting to him as to the others only what he really needs. At the provincial level we occasionally see this tendency in operation in those cases in which authority tends to discriminate between local groups of varying incomes. Groups with significant revenues sometimes receive more easily the authorization for extra expenditures than another poorer group, though the actual needs of the two groups may be identical. If such is the case, it is evident that discrimination is practiced in dealing with local Authentic Sharing in Community / 285 groups, a situation very detrimental in the realization of a truly fraternal community. The Matter o~ Gi~ts It also happens that the reception of gifts sometimes prevents sharing according to need. The religious, benefiting from the generosity of family or friends, is often better provided for than the one who must depend solely on the community. In order to justify the keeping or the use of things received, the religious reasons that he got them gratuitously when he ought rather to be motivated by real need. If our poverty permits us to accept gifts, they must nevertheless be used for all without discrimina-tion. This means that the religious may not have more because he receives more, but that all needs be judged by the same standard and that all be treated in the same manner. Whether the .goods to satisfy our needs comes from within or from outside the community is of lesser consequence. Two other observations must be made here in regard to gifts. Certain religious still declare that the refusal of anything offered to them by their parents, friends, or others, always constitutes a failure against poverty, indeed an injustice to the congregation. As it stands, this statement is inaccurate. The refusal of certain goods offered is sometimes required by our commitment to poverty. Such is the case when an individual or moral person does not need that which is offered, and in addition, the donor re-fuses any transfer of his gift. Such is likewise the case when, in response to a real need, a religious is offered something which can in no way be justified by the norms of simplicity. The second observation bears on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"intention of the donor.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The intention clearly expressed by the donor does not suppress or replace the authorization required for the keeping and the use of goods. A religious cannot go to Europe simply because his parents have given him~the money for the trip. If competent authority refuses him\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the permission and if the intention of the parents about the destination of their gift remains fixed, there is nothing left for the religious to do but to refuse or to return the money. However, in the majority of cases, it is not necessary to be scrupulous about respecting the intention of the donor. Many people offer us small gifts (the notion of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\\\\\" varies considerably, of course) and say to us: This is for you, for your personal needs, clothing, recreation, etc. If we took the time to explain our way of life to them as a community sharing a common fund, they would probably be quite happy to allow one of our companions to benefit from their generosity..Though we rarely explain this to them, we can ordinarily, without any qualms of conscience, pre-sume their understanding acceptance and put in the common fund what-ever we receive. 2116 / Revie.w for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 On the contrary, the intention of the \\xc2\\xb0donor must be respected when the gift is made in the form of an inheritance or legacy. Let us make clear, however, that the religious to whom these goods have been offered alway~ has the right to refuse them. He even has the duty to do so in a case in which the, acceptance of an inheritance or legacy, involves obligations ~otaily or partially in violation of his religious 9ommitments. We must also understand that. authority does sometimes have a word to say in our ac-ceptance or refusal of such goods. The Moral Weight of Competence, Position, and Conduct In this matter of sharing, the professional status of religious some-times operates in his favor. Experience shows that in certain cases the religious~ ,possessing special qualifications obtains what he needs more easily than does his confrere who lacks such competence\\\\\", \\\\\"he may even receive a ~urplu~ while the other is deprived of basic necessities. We have no intention of condemning competence\\\\\", \\\\\"but under pain of closing our eyes to reality, we must acknowledge that this competence does sometimes exercise a moral influence on those presenting their needs, inclining them to ask for more than they really need. It may also influence those whose role is to insure .a just distribution of material resources in their application of the principle of real need. Experience0shows us that a past office may become another pretext for keeping and us_ing certain goods. The religious whose work required a specialized library, for example, may have a strong inclina.tion to keep it even after he no longer occupies the position which once required it. The one who needed a car for his work will be tempted to continue to keep it even after he is transferred to another office which in no way requires its use. Certain personal itnd marginal benefits connected with having a car make it very .painful for him to give it up. Again it may happen that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present position Fay serve as an oc-casion for the granting or obtaining.of favors either for self or for others. Thus a superior, as soon as he is named,.,may ask for a ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99oom with a bath attached. Is this to help him fulfill his office\\\\\\\\\\\\\"moi\\xe2\\x80\\x99e efffctively? Is such an installation really needed for his work? If not, how can he justify requesting it for himself while refusing it to others. It is no more justifiabl~ for a superior to use the pretext of his office to receive and to keep as long as he wishes all the magazines that come to the house. How can one approve such action? If he were in charge of formation and if, with the consent of the community or of authority, he had a prior right or even exclusive right to the use of a magazine published for formation personnel, nobody would complain. But no one can accept, and with reason, that an individual in virtue of his office, keep for himself as long as he likes the newspapers and magazines :meant for the use of all. Such practice is an obstacle to fraternal sharing. The one whose function Authentic Sharing in Community is to build community ought to be the first to ~remove from his own life anything that might compromise it. Let me add as a last moral influence a particular type of conduct in which a few religious indulge when making a request to authority. Their tone, gestures, and manner in general can be so high-handed that it be-comes almost impossible for the superior to refuse, even when he judges superfluous the object requested. When dealing with such persons he per-haps says to himself: It is easier to grant them what they want at once than to put up with the endless scenes and references to the matter that they will make if it is denied them. The superior may even justify his action by saying that he consented in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"order to avoid a greater evil. All the same, that will not prevent those in the community from believing that at times a dif-ficult disposition does get results. While we understand the delicate posi-tion of authority in these instances, we must also recognize that such con-duct on the part of a member of the group can be an obstacle to fraternal sharing as it prevents the application of the principle: each according to need. The Influence of Social Convention According to current styles and in varying degrees, social convention may also influence both the religious in determining his needs, and the su-perior whose role is to assure that fraternal dimension of communal shar-ing proper to a religious household. Ordinarily we find it easier to ask for those things~ accepted by social convention than for those outside it. The superior in turn has a tendency to authorize more quickly those things it approves than those which are indifferent or contrary, to it. In this way social convention sometimes exerts a destructive influence on the charitable quality which ought to characterize our sharing from a common fund ac-cording to individual needs. . In considering the influence of social convention on religious, it cer-tainly explains at least in. part their attitude toward smoking, for example. The religious who smokes normally receives the necessary tobacco even though the expense occasioned ma~, be as high as two or three hundred dollars a year. The need to smoke, createdand developed by him, no longer requires critical evaluation but is taken for granted\\\\\", \\\\\"and when the com-munity budget is prepared, there is no hesitation about\\xe2\\x80\\x99setting aside im-portant sums for it. ~ : It is not at all,certain, on the other h~nd, that the philatelist would so easily be allotted a similar sum for the purchas.e of new stamps. How does it happen that we consent so easily to satisfy the needs of the one who smokes but refuse those of the stamp collector? The pressure of social con-vention would seem to be the exp!anation. Under pain of being considered out of step with the times, religious cannot ignore social convention completelyi but by conforming to it with- 2811 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 out discrimination they can create needs the satisfaction of which amounts to real slavery and causes surprise and even scandal to others. Religious ought to be free enough, for example, in the matter of dress to avoid mak-ing an absolute of an outmoded costume and to consider relative those fashions which social convention seeks to impose on them everyday. This relativity can be expressed in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice of classic styles, simple and few in number, and much less subject to frequent and costly change than those passing fads which are here today and forgotten tomorrow. If it is normal for religious to be aware of social usage and to observe it when in their exterior relations they judge it necessary or useful, they must make the necessary effort to prevent it from entering so deeply into their lives as to create an endless chain of new needs. Let it suffice to men-tion the use of alcoholic drinks. Rare are those social functions, meals, and evenings from Which these are absent. If the religious is not on his guard, in multiplying his social relationships, he risks developing an acute need for alcohol. In this case, satisfaction can never be regarded as liberation, but rather a most insidious form of personal slavery. A Lack of Empathy Lack of empathy is particularly noticeable on those occasions when a religious must submit to a superior or to other members of his group his personal needs in view of an evaluation or control. It may happen that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first reaction is to make comparisons with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own needs, forgetting that each one is unique and therefore different\\\\\", \\\\\"And so the superior says: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why you want to buy this secular outfit\\\\\", \\\\\"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99~ wear one and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never suffered from not doing so. Or again: I never went to hear such and such a singer\\\\\", \\\\\"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see what advantage you can get out of an evening so spent. Such a person never tries to put himself in the position of the one asking in order to be better able to understand his needs. He seeks rather to impose his own values on the other person or again to convince him that he does not have such a need because as superior he himself never experienced it. Without exactly realizing it, the superior may set himself up as a sort of prototype whom the others would profit by imitating. In following this sort of logic, ought he not require others to be hungry at the same time he is and with the same intensity, to be sleepy when he is, and to require the same number of hours of sleep? People incapable of this empathy are quite unable to evaluate the needs of others. We might as well say at the same time that they do not know how to exercise the service of authority, since they will never be able to understand those whom they are supposed to help. They may think they understand others, but as a matter of fact they understand only that which they can project on others. In general the person with little empathy is intolerant, not through ill will, but through his inability to put himself Authentic Sharing in Community / 2119 in the position of others. In wishing them well, he may even impose on them things that may cause them serious harm. Exclusive or Prior Right to Use The use of certain equipment may be necessary for a religious in the fulfillment of his office. It is considered essential for his work and he could not give it up without compromising the task confided to him. Such usage is valid and his confreres readily accept his use of what is neces-sary\\\\\", \\\\\"but if they see that he has reserved for his exclusive use things for which he has no real need, at least at certain times, feelings of discontent-ment and a sense of injustice are not slow in surfacing. An example will help to make my point clear. Let us suppose that my work requires the use of a car quite regularly. On the days when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to make any trips, those times when I travel by plane, am I going to lock up the car when I could just as well let others use it? If I put the car in the garage and the keys in my pocket, and if I force my com-panions to take the bus for their trips when the use of a car would be much appreciated and a real convenience for them, can I say sincerely that I am living the principle of fraternal sharing? In order to justify my conduct, I can no doubt find many reasons: A car is something one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lend to just anybody\\\\\", \\\\\"I must keep the things I need for my work in good condition\\\\\", \\\\\"no one knows how to take care of them as I do\\\\\", \\\\\"it is often a costly business to lend one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equipment\\\\\", \\\\\"thb community has other cars for general use\\\\\", \\\\\"etc. Underneath these reasons, all of which contain some element of truth, there is perhaps another which I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t admit: an undue attachment which makes me a slave of this thing. Deep down I prefer its safekeeping to communion with my brothers. In fact, my refusal to put the car at their disposition, far from favoring inter-personal relations, risks destroying them altogether and setting up barriers which are difficult to break down. If, after such conduct, I dare to repeat that goods should be oriented toward the well-being of the group and the strengthening of mutual relations, I must admit that in practice I sub-ordinate persons to things. If in my work, instead of this exclusive right to the use of equipment, I exercise what may be called a prior right to its use, I will quickly come to realize to what degree this type of use and the mentality which it de-velops favor fraternal union. Nobody denies that there are certain incon-veniences in this kind of sharing, that one risks finding one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s things out of order, not in the same condition as one left them, etc. However, be-fore committing myself to sharing, ought I wait until no such risks are involved? If so, I mi~ght just as well say categorically that I refuse to share. Of course, everyone recognizes the existence of an occasional case when it would be better to keep one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tools exclusively for personal use. Such exceptions, however, do not modify the general rule according to 290 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 which the religious ought to exercise a prior right rather than an exclusive one to the use of those things necessary for the accomplishment of his duties. The first recognizes and favors fraternal sharing, while the second usually cuts it off abruptly. The Proprietor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mentality Every religious making use of community goods can say, and he has reason: This property belongs to me\\\\\", \\\\\"it has been put at my disposition by a moral person called the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"province\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"institute.\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He may be inclined per-haps, in ~order to justify his poverty before those who do not believe in it anymore, to exaggerate the inconveniences of such a situation and to keep silent about the advantages which it affords. Sometimes he will even cover up his possessive attitude with regard to certain things saying that they do not belong to him and therefore he cannot lend them. Under pain of deny-ing the evidence, we must admit that some religious seem to have a pro-prietor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentality with regard to goods belonging to the province or in-stitute. Such a mentality is an obstacle to fraternal sharing. If, in order to illustrate my idea, I use the community treasurer as an example, it is not that this mentality is more widespread among them than among other religious, but because frequent reference is made to them when this topic is discussed. In fact, it often happens that the treasurer acts as if he were the proprietor of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goods. He feels free to ask ques-tions, even indiscreet ones, about the sums of money requested, while actu-ally it is his business simply to hand over what has been authorized. He scolds others for expenditures which he has no right to judge. He may even insist on an itemized account which normally is given to the superior. When he gives out money, his gesture is marked by a pained expression as if part-ing with it hurt him physicallly. If we describe it at its worst, we might say that in keeping the purse-strings, he seems to keep the whole community on a,.leash. This caricature, although rough!y drawn, is not entirely the fruit of the imagination. If I have exaggerated some situations, I have reproduced others with an accuracy that no one can deny. It is not surprising if religious, subjected to caprices of this kind, no longer dare ask the community even for what is necessary, but arrange to obtain it outside, or keep a part of their salary or gifts received, in order to satisfy their needs. The changing of the name \\\\\\\\\\\\\"procurator\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"economist,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"treasurer,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"controller,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or whatever, does not remedy the evil. The real problem is not one of vocabulary, but of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way of thinking, and it is this that must be changed. The bursar must recognize, in theory and in practice, that the property confided to his administration belongs to the community., that his task consists in managing it with competence, and in distributing it amiably to religious whose needs have been approved by authority. His office must not be the scene of daily contention, but rather a place where love operates under the guise of both gift and welcome. Authentic Sharing in Commitnity / Let me express sincere appreciation to all those religious who fill their post as treasurer with competency, interior detachment, and in a spirit of service. Everyone knows that theirs is often a thankless task, and one we could not do without. In accomplishing it with that joy and tact which love knows how to exercise, they can do much towards the realization of the ideal of fraternal sharing according to the real needs of each one. Fear, Embarrassment, Shame, Scruples in Regard to Asking Strange as it may appear, there are still some religious who are unable to express their real needs, who prefer to deprive themselves of what they need rather than ask for it. These religious, either by temperament or for-mation, have developed in themselves a fear, an embarrassment, shame, or even scruples about asking. Among them are those who are not earning, and on this account dare not mention their needs. Some of them think of themselves as a burden to the community. While helping these religious to free themselves from whatever prevents them\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from asking for what they need, authority must take the initiative, offering them and even giving them whatever they may need. If this is considered an exaggeration, it is better to fail on the side of kindness and attention than on that of indifference and privation. It is always easier to notice the people who abuse than those whom we abuse. There also exists on the part of some a certain shame and embarrass-ment about asking which may be the result of our manner of community living and sharing in the past. I understand the uneasiness of those of thirty, forty, fifty, and more who still ask local authority or the treasurer for stamps, letter-paper, tooth-paste, soap, etc., but such a practice of com, munity sharing can no longer be justified in the name of poverty. Though long since outmoded, it has not yet totally disappeared. In my opinion it would be so much simpler, so much more adult and reas6nable, to put all these things for common use in a place where each one could take what he needs as he needs it. It is useless to complain of possible abuse in order to refuse such an elementary practice. The existence of such abuse is inevitable, whatever the manner of living the principle of common sharing. Would it not be better that the abuses accompany an adult practice of sharing instead of a childish and embarrassing one? In conclusion on this point let me say that one of the gravest abuses of the practice of religious poverty is that form of dependence which encourages and even develops personal irresponsi-bility. The Application of Various Formulas for Sharing Though there are several formulas for the sharing of go~ds, I do not in-tend here to present the advantages and inconveniences of each. I wish only to point out that the manner of applying any valid formula is able to trans-form it into an obstacle to fraternal sharing. Take for example the individual 292 / Review ]or Religious, F\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 1974/2 budget. It is, for religious in general, a practical manner for determining needs and when approved, of receiving whatever is necessary to meet them. This does not mean, however, that such a formula is best for all the religious of an institute, or of a province, or of a local community. There are some people who find a personal budget more of a useless bother than a help in practicing religious poverty. Why impose it on them then? On the other hand, why forbid it to the rest of the community just because some do not find it helpful? In ~. word, fraternal sharing is not free when the individual budget is refused or imposed on all alike. In those communities in which, in order to respect personal needs, the community budget is made obligatory and the individual budget optional, uniformity may compromise the quality of fraternal sharing. As regards the community budget it is rare, thanks be to God, to hear people use the argu-ment of uniformity to obtain more, to grant or to refuse permission. Wherever uniformity is the sole criterion for making requests or granting authorization, fraternal charity in the treatment of local groups is often ignored. Though two communities may be made up of the same number of persons, it does not follow that the needs of one be identical to the needs of the other. To respect each group in its uniqueness requires ordinarily both diversity and plurality in the manner of treatment. It is the same for individuals. How can anyone justify uniformity in the amount of money granted annually to religious who make use of a budget? Let us take the matter of clothing, for example. The one who is small and well-built will surely have an advantage over another less well-proportioned, with bulges here and there, not to mention fiat feet! Some would remedy this situation by asking that the first person hand in what he has left over, and that the second ask for what he still needs. However, one must admit that the latter remains in an awkward position as it is always harder to ex-tend the hand to receive than to turn in a surplus. In the end, would it not be simpler and more charitable to leave each one free to evaluate his cloth-ing needs and to ask for the money necessary to take care of them. The individual budget plan by which a uniform lump sum is given to all religious also presents, in actual practice, certain facets detrimental to fraternal sharing. Let us suppose that each religious of a local community receives $2500 annually, and that it is left to him to allocate this sum as he sees fit. Such procedure risks creating unjustifiable inequality. Religious whose parents live a few miles away will spend very little to goto see them regularly, while another having parents living at a distance, can visit them only rarely and under pain of seriously jeopardizing his budget. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this a form of discrimination? Another weakness inherent in this plan is that the religious who can economize will manage to procure all sorts of valuable objects (record-play-ers, tape-recorders, etc.) and will have the clear impression, even the con- Authentic Sharing in Community / 293 viction, that these belong to h, im. Of course, he will feel free to take them with him on changing residenc~. As a last obstacle to fraternal sharing, let me add the refusal a priori of approving several different plains and allowing them to be used within the local community as the memlSers judge best. One would respect individual needs more surely if some wer~ permitted to use an individual budget, while others were given an allowan+e for expenses, and still others received the money necessary as the need arose. There are some very deserving religious who do not have any use for a~ individual budget or for a regular allowance and who desire to continue to~ practice poverty by asking for things as they need them. We violate the fraternal quality of our sharing if we impose on them a plan which burdens rather than frees them in their service of God. Conclusion The practice of fraternal sfiaring to which we are bound bestows on our I . community of goods its evangehcal and religious significance. Indeed, it is in order to strengthen the fraiernal bond which unites us and to express it before the world that we have chosen to put all our possessions into a com-mon fund, and to share them according to the real needs of each one. The obstacles that this sharing mebts in practice prove that it is difficult for all of us, because of our sinful condition, to observe perfectly that which we desire with all our hearts. However, the rehg~ous who recognizes the diffi-culties and makes an effort to leliminate them from his life, demonstrates his faith in those values for whic~ the fraternal community stands and his de-sire to collaborate construct~ve, ly in building it, depending on the support of Jesus Christ, thecenter of oui\\\\\\\\\\\\\" lives, for a more perfect realization of it. The General Chapter of Affairs Joseph F. Gallen, S.J. Joseph F. Gallen, S.J., a specialist !n canon law for religious, writes from St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99.s Church: 321 Willing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Alley\\\\\", \\\\\"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106. Pre-chapter Preparation : Pre-chapter preparation, despite its evident need, was almost univer-sally unknown before post-Vatican II general and provincial chapters. The delegates\\xe2\\x80\\x99to the general chapter should be elected hbout a year before the assehably of the chapter. This will make it possible to have the pre-chapter committees constituted predominantly of chapter members from the begin-ning. The superior general and his council, or a committee appointed by him, could have already inaugurated the work by securing the proposals from the members of the institute and having them arranged according to subject matter. These could be given almost immediately to the pre-chapter committees. The delegates may be elected earlier than a date determined in the constitutions, e.g., six months before the assembly of the chapter. This determination of time is a very accidental aspect of the law, and a rea-sonable cause excuses from it. The more fundamental content of such a law is to elect the delegates at a time that will give the best possible preparation for the chapter. I think myself that a committee of more than five is gener-ally less efficient. If the quantity of the work so demands, several parallel or sub-committees can be designated. As many as possible of those on a com-mittee should be competent in the field of the committee. Each institute should know from its experience of recent chapters and from the problems now facing it just what committees are needed. There should be a steering or co-ordinating committee. Other committees have been on the religious life, vows, constitutions, government, liturgy, formation, apostolate, finances, 294 The General Chapter o] Affairs / 295 retirement, and habit. Canon law has no legislation on committees. There-fore, it depends on the particular institute to determine the committees and their work\\\\\", \\\\\"the members and chairpersons may be elected or appointed or be designated partially by both election and appointment\\\\\", \\\\\"the chairpersons may be elected by the members of the particular committee. Manner of Pre-chapter Committee Preparation The one directing the pre-chapter preparation gives the proposals or chapter matter to the chairpersons of the pertinent committees, who in turn distribute them to the individual members of the committees to ~work up, dividing the matter as evenly as possible. Let us suppose that the following proposal has been assigned to an individual of the government committee: the term of office of the superior general should be reduced from six to five (four) years, with only one immediate re-election permitted. The committee member is to work up a report on this proposal in the manner of a secretary, an objective researcher, not as a supporter or antag-onist of the proposal or as a policy maker. The chapter makes the decision on enactments and policy, not the committee. The first thing the committee member does is to write down the number of the proposal, if these are num-bered. Identical and almost identical proposals are to be treated together on the same report. The committee member therefore next notes on the report the number that submitted it, for:example: 36 handed in this proposal for a five and 15 for a four year term. He then expresses the proposal in one statement or in parts but both in such a way as to permit a yes-no discussion and a yes-no decision. He next, under the heading~of sense, gives any ex-planations of the proposal, always being complete throughout the report but as ~clear and brief as possible. Submitted proposals, are almost, always wordier and more obscure than the example given above, but the term \\\\\\\\\\\\\"im-mediate\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the example above could be briefly explained. He could well conclude the section on sense by a statement such as the following: The pi\\xe2\\x80\\x99oposal contains two ideas, a five (four) instead o1~ a\\\\\\\\\\\\\"six year term andonly one immediate re-election. The heart of his report is in the following sec-tion, in which he gives all~ the reasons for and then all the reasons against the proposal, noting when any of these reasons has greater weight for or against the four than the five year term. He ends the report with his recom-mended decision: to be accepted, to be rejected, to be accepted with modi-fications. It is evident that the reasons for the acceptance or rejection are the favorable or unfavorable reasons he has already listed. He should add his reasons for suggesting modifications. Copies of this report are distributed to all the committee members. They are to be given adequate time for its study. When a sufficient number of reports are ready, they are to be dis-cussed in a committee meeting. The committee confirms, rejects in whole or in part, and corrects the report of the individual member, which thus becomes the committee report. The committee vote on the report and its :296 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 distinct parts should be included on it, e.g., 3 for, 2 against. Reports for all the proposals to be discussed in any period of sessions should be ready be-fore that period begins. These should be distributed to the capitulars at least on their arrival so that they can be properly studied. The failure to have such reports is a primary cause for the many unreflecting, inefficient, and slow general chapters we have had in the post-Vatican II years. Any religious experienced in chapters should see the need of reports of the type described above. They are demanded by evident facts. The primary such fact is that a chapter should make its decisions from convictions based on solid reasons. This will certainly not be attained unless there is a thorough investigation and study of the facts and reasons. It is also a sufficiently evident and most pertinent fact that many of the capitulars will not study the proposals beforehand. The reports will help to lessen their uninformed voting. Many capitulars will not be able to understand some proposals with-out such a report, for example, those who have had no experience in han-dling large sums of money can find financial proposals difficult to understand, and a religious who has not been in the novitiate since he left it thirty years ago will find. many ideas on formation most difficult to grasp. Proposals handed in by chapter members during the chapter should be processed through the pertinent committee in the manner described above. Subject Matter of the General Chapter of Affairs The norm of the practice of the Holy See for this has been the more im-portant matters that concern the entire institute. If the matter is not more important or does not concern the entire institute, it appertains to the ordi-nary government of the general, provincial, or local superiors. In the con-crete this matter has consisted of the proposals submitted by the members, provincial chapters, and the general capitulars during the time of the general chapter. The first observation is that the proposals under one aspect can readily be insufficient. Almost universally the proposals on a particular matter do not touch, at least adequately, all the more important aspects, difficulties, and problems of the particular field. Quite often they are concerned only with its accidental and lesser aspects. Very frequently also the admittance of a proposal will demand as a consequence or antecedently presume another proposal which has not been submitted. In all such cases, the pertinent com-mittee should add the required proposals, noting on each its committee source and the reasons why it was submitted by the committee. It is not very intelligent to have the submitted proposals as the subject matter, with-out designating anyone to point out and supply for the omissions and the lack of balance. In such a system, it can be almost a mere accident that the general chapter faces all the real problems of the institute. There has to be a way of rejecting very expeditiously the proposals that are less important and general or otherwise evidently inadmissible. Each The General Chapter of Affairs / 297 committee should list all such proposals submitted to it, and very early sub-mit this list to the co-ordinating committee. The latter should go over the lists and have them duplicated and distributed to the chapter members. Sufficient time should be granted for the proper study of the lists, and the chapter is then to be asked to reject all of them in the one vote. The per-mitted recourse against rejection should be of the following type. If a capitu-lar, not the one who submitted the proposal as such, believes that any such rejected proposal is worthy of a committee report and chapter discussion, he should hand in this proposal with his reasons for its repeated presenta-tion. The verdict on confirming or rescinding the rejection should not be made by the original rejecting committee but by the co-ordinating com-mittee. This will avoid having the same committee as both judge and de-fendant in the recourse. Greater Reduction of Matter Is Necessary The reduction of the work of the general chapter has to be much greater than the mere immediate rejection of proposals considered less important, less general, or otherwise evidently inadmissible in the past. No general chapter can s.atisfactorily handle a thousand or two thousand proposals. This is true even if the pre-chapter prepa.ration is most thorough and com-plete, The number of proposals that confronted very many post-Vatican II general chapters was prostrating. Nor is it sensible to think of more fre-quent general chapters\\\\\", \\\\\"we have too many now. Not a great number of them have been religiously effective, and there is nothing in multiplication that augurs greater effectiveness. Perhaps the remedy is to cut down very severely the work of the general chapter to the particular matters that are very highly important and urgent and to give much greater attention to policies than to enactments and changes of enactments and laws in particular matters. Present Mentality Few will now even question the statement that we are faced by a crisis of authority. Pope Paul VI has often spoken~ of this crisis, for example: To mention another: there is the excessive emphasis on the right of the indi-vidual to do as he pleases, which leads to the rejection of any and all limits imposed from without and of any and all authority, however legitimate it may be (May 25, 1968, The Pope Speaks, 13 [1968], 222). In this way a mentality is spread which would like to claim that dis-obedience is legitimate and justified in order to protect the freedom that the sons of God should enjoy (January 29, 1970, ibid., 15 [1970], 54). Since therefore it is a visible society, the Church must necessarily have the power and function of making laws and seeing to it that they are obeyed. The Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members in turn are obliged in conscience to observe these laws (December 13, 1972, ibid., 17 [1973], 376). This mentality of hostility tO authority and law is one of the very im-portant and urgent matters that a general chapter must face and strive to 2911 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 change, but it is also a fact that makes one question the enactment of many laws at present. Matters Excluded from the Competence of General Chapters Possessing Experimental Authority These chapters obviously cannot change ( 1 ) divine law, whether natural or revealed\\\\\", \\\\\"(2) and without the previous appro\\xe2\\x80\\x99~al of the Sacred Congrega-tion for Religious and Secular Institutes these chapters may not put into effect anything that is contrary to the common law (canonical prescriptions, laws of Vatican II, and other laws and decrees of the Holy See)\\\\\", \\\\\"nor (3) make any change in the purpose, nature, and characteristics of any institute or in the Rule of an institute (Ecclesiae sanctae, n6. 6). Proposals These are made by the members of the institute and by provincial chap-ters. All are to be encouraged to make proposals\\\\\", \\\\\"all are equally to be counseled to make only good proposals, and this means good for the entire institute. A proposal is to be judged by its content, but an obscure and un-duly long proposal is a certain indication of insufficient thought. The insuffi-ciency in this: case frequently extends to the content of the proposal. To find l~roposals a religious, should go over the life of the individual members and of,the community immediately with God, the community life, and the life of work. He should go through all pertinent books, e.g., the constitutions. He is to evaluate and to find ways to correct and improve the life of sanc-tity, the apostolate, the present policies and trends of the institute, its public image in the Church and in.general. He should evaluate, all innovations of the post-Vatican II years. Have they succeeded, failed, and in each case to what extent? Have the members of the institute become better religious, better participants in the community life, better apostles? What are the big problems facing the institute today? What is their solution? What is the re-ligious\\xe2\\x80\\x99 effectiveness of superiors, their councilors, those in charge of forma-tion, of the works of the al:iOstolate? Is the tenor and style of life in the houses conducive to the religious life, the apostolate, a religiously satisfy-ing community life? Are your proposals solid, progressive without being im-prudent? Do they all propose freedom from something that is difficult and demands sacrifice? Proposals must be signed only and to the extent that this is com-manded by the law of the institute. A final day, well ahead of the opening of the general chapter, must be determined for the handing in of proposals. All, including general capitulars, should hand in their proposals during this tim& The general capitulars retain the right of making proposals during the chapter: Toward the close of the chapter, a date is to be determined be-yond which no proposal will be accepted. All of these provisions are to enable the committees to process the proposals properly and in due time. The General Chapter o/ Affairs / 299. The right to make proposals is determined by the law or practice of the particular institute. Those who do not have this right may suggest proposals, preferably in writing, to ~those who do enjoy the right. The latter may but are .not obliged to accept merely suggested proposals (see Review ]or Re-ligious, 23 [1964], 359-64). Position Papers and Questionnaires These were the high hurdle and wide stream obstacles in the procedure of. so many special general chapters, and few of these chapters landed fully on the opposite bank. Position papers were also at times a means on the part of committees of appropriating to themselves the policy making func-tion of the chapter. Questionnaires were frequently the substitution of a none too reasonable head count for a vote given because of convincing reasons. A background paper or questionnaire is only rarely necessary or advisable, e.g, an intelligent vote, for or against a particular proposal can demand a brief historical description. If so, the background paper should be prepared.~ Authority of the Superior General in Pre-chapter Preparation The superior general, assisted by his council, has authority over the entire pre-chapter preparation. This is evident from the fact that, outside of the general chapter, there is no one else on the general level of authority and from canon 502, which places the institute under his authority (see Ecclesiae sanctae, no. 4). Frequently at least a superior general gives ample delegation to. another religious to direct and supervise this preparation, e.g., to the Chairperson, of the steering or co-ordinating committee. However, the superior general can always lessen or~\\xe2\\x80\\x99withdraw such authority, lie may also always step in to correct and guide particular matters, individuals, or committees. Post-Vatican II general and provinc, ial chapters have often been vanquished in the pre-chapter preparation. The game was lost before it began. The superior general is not arbitrarily to interfere in or hamper the, work of the committees, but he should be completely aware of what is going on in all committees. He should be very sensitive to a too conservative or a too leftist~ approach and, even more practically, ~to a group that is unduly and wrongly influencing the pre-chapter preparation.. \\xe2\\x80\\x99 Attaining a:Universal Voice in Chapters Especially since about 1965 we have had a constant clamor that the religious of temporary vows or other commitment be permitted to be dele-gates to the general and provincial chapters. This has been an outstandingly unreal issue of recent years..The clear fact has been that the young were talking in the chapters and pre-chapter preparation. The voice that was not being heard was that of the older and of many middle-aged religious and chapter members. This has been true also in other discussion groups, for example, local community discussions. Our need and problem of the-mo- 300 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 ment is to hear the older and the middle-aged religious. I doubt that this can be attained at this time except by having the chapter discussions start with small discussion groups. Each group should be composed of religious of all ages. This system would demand a sufficiently competent chairperson and secretary in each group, the report by the secretary of the group, and the distribution of copies of the reports of each group and of the composite report of all the groups before the common discussion of the matter in the whole chapter. The attainment of the most accurate and efficient procedure in this matter demands a very thorough study. Discussion groups are a time consuming means. They could be employed only for the more serious mat-ters. My own sincere judgment, based on the observation of chapters, is that such a means is necessary to hear the voice of the older and of many mid-dle- aged religious, especially of sisters. Part of the factual basis of this judg-ment is the lack of the older and middle-aged voice manifested very gen-erally in post-Vatican II chapters, that is, the effects that.revealed an inex-perienced, imprudent, and exaggerated origin. As far back as 1901, the Roman Congregations governing religious have refused to approve those of temporary vows or other commitment as dele-gates in the general and provincial chapters. Chapter Principles The preceding section on proposals lists fairly adequately the aspects and fields that can give rise to proposals. Proposals can also be drawn from the principles that should guide chapters, communities, and individuals, which we shall give in this section. The supreme principle is that all should seek the greater good of the Church and of the whole institute, not merely of some part of it or of some group in it. Seek the good not merely of the young, but also of the middle-aged and the aged. A high degree of differ-ence in some aspect of life that is verified in any particular country or re-gion should receive its proper consideration. This is to be true not merely of the United States but of any other country, of Germany, France, Italy, England, Japan. Differences do not exist in all aspects of life. The American has no less need of prayer and mortification than the Italian. Obviously no nation is to give the impression of being superior to all other nations. All should retain all the good of the past and be willing to accept all good ideas of the present and of the future. It is equally the duty of all to oppose anything that is useless or harmful to the institute or its members. Any false principle such as disobedience, especially if public, to the govern-ing or teaching authority of the Church should be immediately rejected. The goal in prayer is not freedom but a more universal life of constant prayer. The Holy Spirit guides practically all of us by the ordinary way, and this implies that our problems, difficulties and their solution are at least gen-erally ordinary. Little will be gained from a study of oriental mysticism or concentration or from emphasizing the charismatic. Much will be gained to The General Chapter o] Affairs / 301 the extent that it is realized that the difficulties in prayer are the very ordi-nary things of the lack of desire for sanctity of life, the unwillingness to make the sacrifices that such a life demands, the lack of a realization that prayer demands a constant effort, an impersonal spirituality, a poor introduction to mental prayer, a complicated system or machinery of mental prayer, a neglect of spiritual reading, a life that is merely activist, natural, secular, and similar ordinary things. If a chapter accepts open placement, how can the institute staff missions, colleges, hospitals, schools, homes for the aged? Can there be a generally satisfying community life when there is unlimited home visiting and unlimited going out for diversion? W.hy always leap to the new, the youthful, the leftist? Certainly sometimes the old, the moderate, the conservative is the true, the relevant, the practical. Why run to manage-ment consultants before you have tried a thorough investigation, study, and planning on your own? If any advisers gave false and imprudent advice, this advice can be the perfect mirror of what was wanted. List everything that your institute has adopted in renewal and adaptation. How many of these have helped the members to become better religious, better apostles, better Catholics? It is certainly not easy to start all over\\\\\", \\\\\"neither is it any too comfortable to be on a plane that is speeding to certain extinction. The dominant thought of any chapter has to be the spiritual, the su-pernatural, the eternal not only with regard to the personal lives of the in-dividual religious but also to the apostolate and community life. Natural development and fulfillment and social work are important but not primary, nor are they the soul of the religious life or of its apostolate. Reject ideas and proposals that are disproportionately expensive. All experimentation in the Church and much more its worship should be carried out in a manner that is adult, mature, dignified, restrained rather than undisciplined and reckless, and not marred by the extremes of either the right or the left. The common saying is that religious dress is not an important question. This is true of religious dress in the abstract and considered merely in itself. In its effects and ramifications, religious dress, especially of women, is certainly an important question. In the past the error was to identify the old with the true, the good, and the relevant\\\\\", \\\\\"the same error is verified now with regard to the new. Re-evaluate every post-Vatican II experiment and change. In-vestigate every question and adopt the solution that the facts demand or counsel\\\\\", \\\\\"do not start off with a new structure or theory. The goal is only secondarily to renew and adapt the institute\\\\\", \\\\\"the primary purpose must be to influence the religious to renew and adapt themselves. The thrust is pri-marily personal, not institutional. There is one essential test of past, present, and future experimentation. Does it produce greater sanctity of life, a deeper and wider community life, a greater spiritual effect in the apostolate? One of the most important qualities demanded in superiors and chapters today is the courage to stand with the wise and oppose the foolish. How many of your schools, colleges, and other institutions are very secular? Can you 302 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 justifiably allow this to continue and progress? Take anything and every-thing that is good and helpful from psychology and sociology, but never forget that they are no substitute for revelation, morality, or spiritual theol-ogy. How many factual studies were made that proved the later difficulties and defections of religious were found especially in those who entered im-mediately after high school? Honestly face the vocation problem and any of its causes that may exist in the individual and collective lives of your re-ligious. It is possible to emphasize the dignity of the married life without denigrating the religious life. Is the life style of your religious in conformity with the deep totality of the religious consecration? Do all things conduce to greater sanctity, better community life, and a more spiritual apostolate? Are we complaining about the lack of inspiration in the religious life after we buried it in selfishness, materialism, and naturalism? Adopt only what gives at least solid probability of success\\\\\", \\\\\"otherwise your conduct is at least ordinarily imprudent or even rash. Procedure in lhe Chapter The chapter procedure should be kept as simple and uncomplicated as possible. The need of recourse to parliamentary procedure should be infre-quent, and each institute is now in a position to list the few parliamentary rules that are practical. The secretary of the chapter is to post the agenda for the sessions of a day at least on the preceding evening.

Among the growing movements among American religious in the past few years has been the directed retreat. In increasing numbers, religious have placed themselves under a director who has guided their meditation for periods as long as thirty days.1 The movement owes much to the Jesuits, who have taken leadership throughout the countr~ in reviving an approach to the retreat that is closely linked with their own renewal and spirituality.2 There have been spinooffs from the directed retreat movement that sug-gest that directed retreats are much more than a passing fad, although for some they will take on that character. The first of the side benefits of the directed retreat movement has been that religious of a number of congregations, especially women, are being trained in the method and approach of directing prayer. The Jesuits have established centers for this purpose, and programs for training, using the Ignatian retreat, are well patronized. A congequence of this is the flowering of directed retreats among women religious,, and the better training of for-mation personnel capable of working with mature nuns. Secondly, the directed retreat seems to bring many religious to long-term spiritual direction. Foi\\\\\" the first time, for many religious, ~it has been possible--in a directed retreat--to consider spiritual direction as some- 1See, for example, Margaret Baker, H.V.M., \\\\\"My Experience of a Directed Retreat,\\\\\" Review for Religious, v. 31 (1972), pp. 573-7\",\"Sister Christine Freed, R.G.S., \\\\\"I Feel like Singing Forever,\\\\\" Review ]or Religious, v. 32 (1973), pp. 1379-1384. \\xe2\\x80\\x99-\\xe2\\x80\\x99Thomas E.

While one can comment only impres-sionistically, it seems that a real phenomenon of the past three years has been the increased desire among religious for spiritual direction.:\\xe2\\x80\\x99 While the pattern is not so clear as to the expectations.of the religious seeking direction, the question of growth in prayer is always a serious considera-tion. The direction of prayer itself has an ancient and honorable tradition in the Church. From the earliest days of Christianity, the spiritual novice submitted himself or herself to a spiritual guide under whose direction growth in the life of prayer was undertaken. The stories of the fathers of the desert reinforce this strongly, and direction in prayer was for them an all-important issue in the relationship between novice and adept Chris-tian. The origins of this are obscure, but it would seem that the earliest forms of direction in prayer come from the baptismal catechesis, where the person responsible for the conversion of a neophyte not only helped in the education of the candidate for baptism, but particularly assumed the task of.teaching them the spiritual life. Together the two shared a period of prayer and \\xe2\\x80\\x99fasting before the administration of the sacrament.\\\\\" In modern times, with the structure of the annual or other periodic retreat, various forms or styles of retreats came to the fore. The Ignatian r~treat has always had, in this period, a special place. It has been widely used b~, religious whose congregations are not Ignatian in spirituality, and its very basic Christian themes have made it equally.popular among lay-people. Although the preached retreat had become the predominant form, the notion of the directed retreat never died out, and its revival on such a large scale is in reality a return to an earlier Ignatian tradition. The Notion of the Directed Retreat The focus in the directed retreat is on the notion of \\\\\"directed.\\\\\" It is a retreat in which the pfirticipant works with the retreat master in the man-ner of a s~iritual director. There is normally an hour-long interview each day, during which the retreatant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer is evaluated, directions and themes are~ given for further meditations, and the quality of the retreatant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is developed? As indicated above, although the nature of the directed retreat has ancient roots in the Church, it has been most characteristic o~ Jesuit re-aSee Sandra Marie Schneiders, I.H.M., \\\\\"The \\xe2\\x80\\x99Return\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to Spiritual Direction,\\\\\" Spiritual Lile, v. 18 (1972), pp. 263-78. 4Michel Dujarier, Le parrainage des adultes aux trois premiers siO(les de l\\xe2\\x80\\x99Eglise (Paris: 1962), p. 377. 5Herbert F. Smith, S.J., \\\\\"The Nature and Value of a Directed Retreat,\\\\\" Review ]or Religious\",\",v. 32 (1973), pp. 490-7. This article is available from Review ]or Religious as a separate reprint. Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / ~259 treats in recent years. The point needs to be made that the nature of this retreat is simply the direction of prayer itself, adapted to the peculiar de-sign of a retreat, a period of time in which a person withdraws from ordi-nary pursuits to develop more consciously and deliberately in the spiritual life. Admittedly, among American religious other values have also entered in,, but this has always been understood as the essential purpose of retreat. For, a religious working far from the center of his province~ in a small community, the value of fellowship is a real one, for example. Some province retreats resemble a tribal gathering in this regard, and others use a workshop model rather than the traditional one of withdrawal for prayer. The comments that follow will be placed in the context of directed re-treats, but they might as easily apply to much of the real work of spiritual direction. Direction in prayer, even the special, concentrated form of di-rected meditation used in directed retreats, is the heart of spiritual direc-tion. An aspect of regular ~direction, even if relatively infrequent, is sug-gestions for prayer, the joint evaluation of movements in prayer, the dis-cernment of these movements, and help in heeding the call to new levels of prayer. The purpose of this article, however, is not to explore the nature and values, of the directed retreat, but to discuss its use to inculcate the values from the founding charism of a particular ~religious congregation. The question of the nature of th~ directed retreat has been explored in depth elsewhere.\\\\\" What has not been investigated at any point is how the tech-nique of the directed retreat can contribute to the deepening of the ~ommit-ment of a religious to his/her \\xc2\\xb0founding charism. Because non-Ignatian development of the directed retreat has been so\\xc2\\xb0limited, the paucity of in-formation on the topic is understandable. What follows here is based on the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study within the documents of his own order, as well as at-tempts to work with sisters of two other,groups attempting to find better means for developing their own spirituality within their members. The Founding Charism .In recent attempts among religious to heed the directives of Vatican II that they renew .themselves in the spirit of\\xe2\\x80\\x99their founders and foundresses, the emphasis has been placed upon research and the question of teaching the proper spirit of the order to cb.ndidates,r Along with this has gone the concern for finding newer expressions for the origina! teaching of the founder, while remaining faithful to his/her intent. This has produced some valuable materials in some groups, some false starts in others\",\"there ~William A. Barry, ~S.J., \\\\\"The Experience of the First and Second Weeks of the Spiritual Exercises,\\\\\" Review ]or Religious, v. 32 (1973), pp. 102\\xe2\\x80\\x99-9. See also the same author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\\\\"Silence and tl~e Directed Retreat,\\\\\" Review ]or Religious, v. 32 (1973), pp. 347-51\",\"and Smith, \\\\\"The Nature and Value of a Directed Retreat.\\\\\" rVatican Council II, The Renewal o/Religious LiIe, no. 2. Review [or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 have been elements of both renewal and deception in the experience of getting in touch with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roots. In the directed retreat, the issue changes somewhat. The purpose of the retreat is not to analyze, speculate, or study. It is to experience the meaning of the life of the Lord in a renewed sense. It is to deepen one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prayer, and to deal with issues that affect the spiritual life. When we speak of a directed retreat designed to inculcate the values of the spirituality of a religious congregation, therefore, the point is that the important elements of that spirituality must be assembled in what may be new ways, intended to move the soul through prayer more than grouped in perfectly logical structures. The experiential dimension, and the very goal of the directed re-treat according to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own charism, is to bring the retreatant to the ex-perience that the founder had in founding the congregation. One must experience the foundation within oneself as a truly authentic, congruent integration of the spiritual life. It should make sense, bring an interior peace, and strongly confirm one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to this congregation at this time in history. Few religious have taken themselves, or been taken, through the experience of the founder or foundress.\\xe2\\x80\\x99By this is not meant that the privations or sufferings of the founder--the more dramatic ele-ments of his/her life--need be reproduced in some sort of role playing. Indeed, the point is the reproduction of the insight and inspiration of the founding charism itself. What elements of the Christian experience brought about the development that the religious knows as his/her spiritual legacy? How were the evangelical counsels and the gospel message ex-perienced by the founder in such a way that the foundation of this group became a means of incarnating these values? If the congregation is the incarnation of the values of the founder--an extension of his/her charism into history--how is it to be experienced, personally by the members and corporately by the community as a whole? The questions above zero in on the issues that the directed retreat can deal with, in terms of the founding charism of a congregation. What is ob-vious, then, is that the design of the retreat must be developmental, and that might well be, as stated above, quite different from the design used to teach the ideas of the charism, or to study them. Critical Elements of a Founding Charism What, then, are the elements of a founding charism that must be con-sidered in designing such a retreat experience? The Spiritual Exercises are a brilliant example and deserve to be studied, even by those whose spiritual tradition differs sharply from that of the Jesuits. The themes, from the \\\\\"Two Standards\\\\\" to the last consideration, are highly developmental. Each builds on what precedes, not so much intellectually, but in the context of faith. It is possible to find all the elements of the Christian life from conversion Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / 261 to union with God. In short, a spiritual path is described. At the same time, the style of the retreat is congruent with the highly personal emphasis on decision and discernment. The Ignatian directed retreat is characterized (usually, although there are exceptions) by lone meditation, usually at some length, by minimal communal aspects, and by minimal liturgical life. The focus is on the individual coming to grips with his/her personal relationships with the Lord, with an acceptance of that Lordship in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, and in the development of a prayer life that nourishes and defines that relationship. What then are the elements of a founding charism that are critical to the development of directed prayer in this ~evelopmental sense? Four ele-ments surface in any investigation of this question: method of prayer, ascetical and/or devotional practices, a spiritual system, and theological concepts. These are the elements that the designer of the retreat prayer experiences needs to coordinate. The study that makes this possible should be on the part of the retreat director, and the retreatant should not be called o\\xe2\\x80\\x99n to do other than move immediately into the prayer experience. .Let us, then, briefly look at each of these elements of the founding charism in turn. Method of Prayer The first critical question is whether the founder taught a method of prayer, particularly a method of meditation. In many cases, what will be discovered is that the founder/foundress did .use a currently popular method of meditation, but that it was a matter of convenience in instruct-ing novices, and not an important element of the spirituality of the con-gregation. Here some communal discernment is necessary. In reading the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letters of direction, for example, or instructions on prayer, it is necessary to discover the significance of any proper method to the totality of his/her founding charism. If a distinct approach, emphasis, or technique is present, it should be integrated in the directed prayer of the retreat experience, For instance, a congregation consecrated to Mary might well have developed a receptive approach to prayer based on an understanding of Our Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiat, a disposition of total availabi!ity to the Lord. It would hardly be congruent in such a case to suggest.an aggressive, intellectual type of mental prayer. It would surely conflict with many of the themes that the founding charism will c6ntain. Ascetical and/or Devotional Practices This area, like the last, deserves careful work to determine the con-tinuing value of the ascetical and/.or devotional practices of the founder. Things which are merely characteristic of the nationality or culture of the founder may be safely set aside, and tangential devotions may also be ex-cluded. After all, even founders and foundresses are entitled to devotional 262 / Review 1or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 expressions which are uniquely personal, and without having these pro-jected onto their religious foundations! In what sense is the devotion in-volved in the direction that the founder gave his/her early members? What is its theological content? A founder or foundress with a great de-votion to the cross, who writes and speaks of the cross in such a way that it permeates the spirituality of the order, is teaching something of greater import than a founder with a great personal devotion to a. patron saint or to a shrine. Similarly, the practice of taking names in religion may have been merely the religious convention of the time of foundation, or it may have had specific meaning~ Other ascetical practices are.to be similarly evalu-ated. In one tradition, the regulations of the founder about the diet may have been a simple indication of poverty within his .cultural context\",\"in another tradition, the manner in which the question is treated might indi-cate that the retreat should include some fasting, if possible, and with cerr tain goals in mind. A Spiritual System The most obvious element is the spiritual system of the foundation. Did the founder have an approach to spirituality which he taught to the early members? What virtues did he consider important, especially, what aspects of the Christian life did he consider characteristic of his founda-tion? What were his interpretation and understanding of evangelical chastity, poverty, and obedience, and did this differ from the prevailing understand-ings of his time? Did the foundation include any other vows besides the three traditional ones, even though these may no longer exist in the con-gregation? What was the value that the founder/foundress was stressing by having additional vows? What was his/her notion of common life and community experience? What is the role of the apostolate in fostering the spiritual life? All these are part of the questions that must be asked in the process of constructing the spiritual system of the founder or foundress, as, usually in most cases, active founders have not written out the spiritual system in clear fashion. Besides exploring the documents of the congregation, however, the living experience of the early foundation is itself of importance. The story of the life of the founder is often of great value in determining what he meant by a certain teaching. Religious orders are, after all, not only com-munities, but a special modality of community--witness communities that show forth the transcendent dimension of Christian life. The witness of the early foundation, therefore, is of great importance as a form of teach-ing. Theological Concepts Usually, theological concepts do not appear in a founding charism as Directed Prayer and the Founding Charism / 263 such. Founders and foundresses are rarely interested in theology except as it reveals the person :of Jesus Or underlies a religious value. Nevertheless, founders are usually very concerned about fidelity to the deposit of faith. A renewed understanding of theological concepts in recent years may make it possible to enrich the understanding of the founder. The founding charism does not really change, but the religious order is called to fidelity to it, not to literal acceptance in the language, cultural norms, and symbols of the early society. As the Church grows in its understanding, of herself and her divine mission, so \\xe2\\x80\\x99a religious congregation should show signs of growth in its self-understanding.\\xe2\\x80\\x99To utilize a theological concept such as the Eucharist without integrating the better insights coming from a renewed liturgy of celebration would be more than unfortunate. It would be .a denial of the fidelity\\xe2\\x80\\x99of the founder to the Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teaching, because as he was faithful to ~the Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expression of eternal truth in his time and culture, so the congregation, today must reproduce that fidelity. Again, renewed Biblical scholarship has made possible far greater sophistication in understanding the gospel message than heretofore. That cannot be ignored in studying the founding charism, merely because it has happened since the founder died! The \\xc2\\xb0emphasis laid upon the experiential above is not to be interpreted as demeaning the importance of the intellectual as preparation for prayer. Anti-intellectualism is not a mark of the Christian, Quite the contrary, and the directed prayer experience will be the richer for the .hours spent by both ~director and retreatant in studying the basic teaching ,of the Church, especially in those areas that touch upon the founding charism. ~Fhe Retreat ~s Reflection of the Founding Charism The first of the elements of a founding charism was stated as the method of meditation or mental prayer. The idea of the importance of the ,congruence of this with~the total spirituality of the founder or foundress was stressed, but this idea can also be expanded~. The entire style of the directed retreat should reflect the founding.charism. The import/race of this cannot easily be exaggerated because of ~he\\xe2\\x80\\x99experiential nature of:the directed retreat. There\\\\\" is a profound difference between the directed re-treat., as desert experien.ce (silence, lone meditation at great length, and so forth) and the directed retreat as communal\\xe2\\x80\\x99,experience (common liturgi-cal celebrations,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 some group discussion, and so forth). In among these contrasts are many modalities of directed retreat, of course. The point is that it is important to include those aspects which will most effectively help the retreatant to gro~w into the values which are the subjects of the prayer experiences. The spirituality that emphasizes a deeply communitarian-or service value will not come through successfully in a desert experience. This i~ not to say that the desert experience is not of value for religious f~\\xe2\\x80\\x99om adtive commui~ities~(far from it!), but only that a limited aspect of their spirituality is likqly to emerge in such a context. Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 Similarly, methods of discernment should be congruent with the found-ing charism itself. What was the method for discerning the will of God used by the founder or foundress? Was it a communal means, or one based on authority? Discernment itself has become an issue, both within the directed retreat movement and in other contexts? It is an integral part of the Spiritual Exercises, and would seem to be an integral part of the work of the director of prayer. Within a given tradition, the method of dis-cernment might well be prophetic or charismatic. More likely it will reflect an authoritarian tone, which would translate into the directed retreat as a form of obedience to the spiritual guide. This type of obedience itself needs to be understood, as it isnot the same as the obedience owed a superior under the evangelical vow. In some traditions, the means of discernment might be very communal, in such a way that group direction might be a compatible style for certain congregations using the directed retreat. This would be alongside the pri-vate interview, which is essential to the directed retreat. A final word should be added on the place of resolutions. Many re-ligious feel strongly that they should come home from retreat with clear resolutions for the future--a battle plan, so to speak. The presumption is so strong with many that it is an issue that should be frankly discussed with the director. It is certainly not necessary for the directed retreat\",\"it is enough that there be an interior renewal and deepened commitment to the spirit of the foundation. Whether there are \\\\\"results\\\\\" or decisions on con-crete action for the future should flow from the needs of the person him-self/ herself. Too often it is merely another expression of a workaholic personality. Conclusion This has been a simple and sketchy view of the development of a directed retreat from the point of view of the goal of growth in the spirit of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own order. As such, directed prayer is a powerful means of growth toward incarnating in oneself the values of the founding charism. It is a means of renewal that not only affirms one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to religious life, but also goes far toward building and renewing the community through renewed religious, standing firmly in the tradition of the one who brought the order into being under God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace. 8Criticism has been recently expressed by W.

Discernment Today In our attempts to seek and find God in our lives and to live out our Chris-tian lives of faith, hope, and love, we are often involved in a process of rediscovery. There is not that much that is new for us in the sense of dis-covering something for the first time. But often the conditions of the times in which we live and our own felt needs combine to lead us to focus on a particular aspect of the spiritual life. Such, I would suggest, is the case in the area of discernment. It is certainly a term that has deep roots in the history of Christian spirituality. But ours is a period that has seized upon the process of discernment--perhaps too quickly and too glibly at times-- in the hopes that it might aid us in our efforts to love and serve God both as individuals and as communities, and to seek and respond more gener-ously to His will in our lives. This renewed interest in discernment should come as no surprise. First of all, there is the very visible desire of many to deepen their own union with God, to establish or reestablish what they consider the essentials and priorities in their lives, and to make any required decisions in a context of faith and prayer. In a time of great change, many are seeking to find strength and unity within themselves not only to cope effectively with their lives and all their responsibilities, but also. to maintain themselves as lov-ing and productive persons. Secondly, many communities are turning to the process of discernment as a method of helping them in their attempts at renewal as a community and as a basis for group decisions. But whether 265 266 / Review for Religious, ~olume 33, 197.4/2 it is a case of individual discernment or corporate discernment, it is impor-tant to stress over and over that the basis of any discernment has to be the deep and intense prayer of the persons involved in the process. The context of any true discernment is prayer. The purpose of this article, then, is to offer some reflections on discernment, using the word in the broadest sense here and focusing on the intimate connection between discernment and prayer. ontex! Is Prayer Discernment really makes sense only when it is situated in the context of prayer. Unless there is a corresponding desire to seek and find God continually in our lives and to deepen our awareness of His reality and presence, discernment can end up just being talk. The seeking and yearn-ing attitude of the Psalmist must penetrate our own lives deeply: \\\\\"To you, my heart speaks\",\"you my glance seeks, your presence, O Lord, I seek. Hide not your face from me\\\\\" (Ps 27:8-9). There is, of course, a renewed in-terest and even a hunger on the part of many today in the area of per-sonal prayer\",\"and this accounts in part for the renewed interest in the area of discernment. There are many indications of this all around us at the present time\",\"and many are definitely expressing a desire for praye~r which springs from a felt human need and the presence of the Spirit in our midst, ever renewing, ever arousing. Recently I was listening to a taped conference on prayer by Thomas Merton in which he mentioned at the beginning that he ~did not like to talk a great deal about prayer. This was certainly not from any disinterest, for if there is any constant preoccupation and interest that emerges in his life and writings, it would be with the value and priority he constantly gives to prayer. But he wanted to stress the point that pr~yer for us should be something simple and natural, something as simple and natiaral as breath-ing. It is hard for us to talk about breathing since it is such a normal process of our lives and one wfiich we can easily take for granted. So, too, he feels should be the case with prayer. At times we can complicate it and make an issue or a cause out of it. But usually when we make a~ca~]se or an issue out of something, we oppose it to something else: \\\\\"This is.prayer, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. This is something sacred, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\\\\" The f~us could then shift to the issue rather than the reality, and prayer could then be viewed as something complicated and artificial. Perhaps we can best consider prayer as the simple, natural, continual response of one who is,. convinced he be-longs to God and seeks to grow in union with Him, and the response of one who realizes he is a person possessed by a loving God. And it is in this climate, this atmosphere of prayer tl~at the whole process of discern-ment should be placed. The context is a very normal, full, and serious seek-ing after God. Pray\\xe2\\x80\\x99~r.\\\\\" The Context o[ Discernment / 267 The Process of Discernment \\xe2\\x80\\x99 Discernment, then, should not be considered a cause or an issue nor ev~en\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a method in itself. It is a process in prayer by which one seeks seri-ously to know and follow God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will, to hear His call and faithfully and generously respond in the very real life situation of the person concerned. If l~ra~er should be a very human and ordinary experience, so too should b6 discernment. In this sense, it is a very simple process\",\"and yet, on the other hand, it can be difficult in the sense that it presupposes constant efforts at\\xe2\\x80\\x99a deep and continuous union with God through prayer. This re-quires perseverance, patience, and willingness to expend time and energy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cannot be turned off and on like a water faucet if it is to be effective\",\"it presupposes a firm basis of faith and the continuous seeking of the presence of the Lord. ~Alth0ugh discernment is a word that can come easily to the lips, it can still remain a rather elusive concept. Perhaps this is because it pre-soppos~ so much else. At any rate, we might recall Father Futrellrs defi-nition that discernment \\\\\"involves choosing the way of the light of Christ instead of the way of the darkness of the Evil One and living out the con-sequences of this choice through discerning what specific decisions and ac-tions a~e, demanded to follow Christ here and now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x991 Thus discernment focuses on the ongoing attempts to clarify and ascertain God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will in our lives and seeks to specify what actions and decisions are required in the life of \\\\\"on\\xe2\\x80\\x99e who wishes to follow Christ tothlly. The process presupposes an int\\xe2\\x80\\x99eflse desire, hunger, and willingness to seek God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will and to embrace it generously once one has come to a reasonable certitude regarding it. W~ might say it all comes down to our attempts to hear and respond to:the wo~\\xe2\\x80\\x99d of God in our own unique lives. But. if we are to be sensitive t~lGod speaking to us in the many ways He does.in our liv6s, we must first hear His call\",\"we must listen quietly and give Him frequent opportuni-ties to speak to us. If we fire to b~ sensitive to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence and attentive to His touch, there must be an element of stillness and listening. Since this listening~aspect is so important for discernment, we should not be surprised to find this aspect of prayer being re-e~mphasized today.2 Many are ex-periencing the need today to.. take time out from all their activities in order to turn within and seek God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence within, to contemplate Him and to listen to Him in the stillness of their hearts. It is a kind of active receptivity as we let the radical truth of God shine forth with its own life within us. We seek to make the words of the P~almist our own: \\\\\"In your light we see light.\\\\\" It is in this atmosphere .of stillness and presence that one can best determine God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s touch, God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will. ~John C. Futrell, S.J., \\\\\"Ignatian Discernment,\\\\\" Studies in the Spirituality o] Jesuits, v. 2, no. 2, p. 47. \\xe2\\x80\\x99-\\xe2\\x80\\x99See, for example, W. Norris Clarke, S.J., \\\\\"Be Still and Contemplate,\\\\\"~ New Catholic World, November-December 1972, pp. 246 ft. 2611 / Review [or Religious, l/\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 1974/2 Building on the Past As we seek to see clearly where God is touching us at a given time and where He is leading us and asking us to respond and follow, it is very help-ful to grow in the awareness of where God has touched us and nourished us0 in the past. Each of us has his or her own unique history in the hands of a loving God, that is, significant events, persons, books, Scripture pas-sages, and so forth, that have been a source of great strength and help. All of this constitutes our own faith experience of God\",\"and the more it is brought to our conscious awareness, the more it becomes our own. Often in discernment workshops or faith sharing experiences, methods and oppor-tunities are presented to help individuals grasp more explicitly what they uniquely possess of God in their lives. One can call this by various names: one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core experience of God, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beauty within, one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name of grace, and so forth. But it all comes down to the same reality: we seek to realize what we already possess, what is uniquely ours, and where God has touched us and loved us significantly. Once we are more aware of how God has acted in our lives in the past, we can more easily return in a spirit of prayer to be nourished and strengthened and sustained. What has sustained us in ~the past and what has touched us before, can sustain us and touch us again. This conscious awareness also helps us to be more responsive and sensitive to where God is touching us now, where He is leading us. We can begin to see a pattern and a continuity in our lives of faith. Above all, we be-come more aware of the profoundest reality of our lives, namely that which we possess of the power and love of God that has worked within us in the past and continues to be operative in the present. Discernment in prayer, then, is an ongoing process that seeks to find God and His will in our lives\",\"it involves a constant seeking of God and an awaren(ss of His presence in our lives. Through discernment one seeks to hear God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuous call, to recognize it as clearly as possible in order to follow it as faithfully and generously as possible. It seeks to answer the question: How can I best love and serve God in the present circumstances of my life. It is an ongoing process because our lives, our experience, our work, our relationship with God is an ongoing process. His Word does not come to us in a vacuum but in the concrete circumstances of our everyday lives. As Thomas Merton says in one of my favorite passages from his writings: Every moment and every event of every man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life on earth plants some-thing in his soul. For just as the wind carries thousands of winged seeds, so each moment brings with it germs of spiritual vitality that come to rest im-perceptibly in the minds and wills of men. Most of these unnumbered seeds perish and are lost, because men are not prepared to receive them\",\"for such seeds as these cannot spring up anywhere except in the good soil of freedom and love.3 aThomas Merton, New Seeds of Contemplation (New York: New Directions, 1961), p. 14. Prayer: The Context of Discernment / 269 In a very true sense, it is only the faith-filled person, the contemplating person that is acutely sensitive to these seeds of God in his or her life. And for the soil of freedom and love to flourish in our own lives, we must con-stantly open ourselves to the Spirit of God through an abiding spirit of prayer. Not only must we seek to grow sensitive to God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speaking to us in the external events of our lives, but we must seek to grow in an awareness and sensitivity to the movements within ourselves as we react personally to the signs of His will and presence. How do my present reactions corre-spond to the felt experience of God that has been so much a part of my life in the past? Are my present movements in resonance with that source of peace, that sense of oneness and wholeness before God that I have ex-perienced before, that sense of belonging to God that has been so nourish-ing and sustaining in my life? Are they consistent with the normal signs of the Spirit working within us, the signs of \\\\\"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility and self-control\\\\\" (Gal. 5:22-3)? These are some of the questions one seeks to clarify in order to fulfill the desire to seek and find the Lord and His will. The spiritual director can play an important role in assisting here, for at times we can be too close to ourselves to have the needed objectivity. The director can aid us in clarifying and objectifying our own experiences and interior movements and aid us to see where God is touching us, loving us, and indicating His presence and His will. A Sense of Freedom In addition to a deep and constant spirit of prayer, discernment also requires an attitude of freedom and detachment. The attitude of freedom I refer to is that which allows a person to give to God and His will the central place in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life\",\", it is a freedom and detachment from all other things that would either prevent or hinder one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s striving to focus On God. It is the sense of freedom that allows God to become and remain the cen-tral reality in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. The Psalmist speaks of this centrality with the words: \\\\\"As the eyes of the servant are on the hands of the Master, so my eyes are on you, O Lord.\\\\\" It is the freedom that allows one to respond generously to Jesus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 invitation to Matthew, \\\\\"Come, follow me,\\\\\" and His words to the disciples of John the Baptist, \\\\\"Come and see.\\\\\" Come and see and taste the goodness of the Lord. It is the freedom expressed in the words of the prophet Samuel, \\\\\"Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening\\\\\" (1 Sam 3:10), and the words of the Psalmist, \\\\\"Here am I, Lord, I come to do your will\\\\\" (Ps 40:7-8). We might note in passing that there can be an intimate connection between this spirit of freedom and a lifestyle that is marked by a spirit of simplicity. How does one grow in this spirit of freedom? Ultimately it is through a cooperation with the power of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grace and love working within us. 270 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 But one important way is through a deepening realization that one is a loved sinner, that one has been touched and healed. A profound convic-tion of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steadfast love and fidelity can be a very liberating force that enables one to turn to God and seek Him alone and His service in a spirit of simplicity and joy. This freedom grows in a context of lively faith and is nourished in prayerful reflection on God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goodness, mercy, love, and providence. Conclusion In general, discernment in prayer is an inward looking process\",\"the focus is mainly on the movements and experiences of God within us. But the process must never stop here for there should also be an outward dimension of discernment. First of all, as in so many areas of the spiritual life of man, a healthy norm is: \\\\\"By their fruits you shall know them.\\\\\" There is a confirmatory aspect of all discernment in the external fruits that are in evidence and the good works that are produced. Secondly, the great commandment,of love must always be kept in perspective, and a deepening union with God should lead to a deepening union with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fellow man. An increasing sense of compassion for one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fellow man and his needs should flow from one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s union with God. Finally, the process should lead to an increasing sensitivity to life and all its mysteries, to an increasing awareness of.God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence in all things, and to our own growth as-con-templatives in action. A Norwegian Outpost: Maria Einscete M. Basil Pennington, O.C.S.O. Father M. Basil Pennington, O.C.S.O., is a Cistercian monk of St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Abbey\",\"Spencer, Massachusetts 01562. Our plane put down at Oslo and I soon bungled my way through customs, only .to find--no one. Communications had gotten a bit confus(d and now there was no one there. But everyone I asked seemed t6 know of him: \\\\\"Brother Robert, yes, the hermit. He lives up in the mountains near Lake Tinn.\\\\\" And so I began my pilgrimage. Ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the next night I stepped down from a bus in the pouring rain and made bold to ask the young lady who alighted with me the oft repeated question: \\\\\"Where is Brother Robert? .... That way,\\\\\" she answered with a bold sweep of the arm as her hand pointed up a dark rise of conifers. I turned in the opposite direction to the friendly lights of an inn. It was a good choice. There among the youths gathered around the blazing fire was Jan. A couple years earlier he had been up to see the hermit with his pastor. He offered to be my guide. Good to his word, Jan arrived early the next morning with his little Volkswagen which took us as far as it could. Then we began to climb on foot. I was a bit embarrassed when Jan took my bag, but soon I was very grateful that he had--for otherwise I probably would never have made it. We must have climbed steadily, along an old logging trail, for forty-five minutes or more when Jan sudde.nly stopped and pointed back into the woods. We had actually passed our goal: Maria Einscete--Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hermit-age. Maria Einscete was just a simple log cabin, one just like so many others in those forests. Larid in Norway belongs to the owner by hereditary right. It cannot be \\\\\"definitively alienated. Most families living in the villages or on the lowland farms own stretches of woodland up on the mountains. 272 / Review ]or Religious, l,\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 197/.\\xe2\\x80\\x99-/2 In better times they kept men up there ,to care for the woods, but now most of these lumberjack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabins are empty. One of these landlords, a kindly man, let Brother Robert use his abandoned cabin, plant some vege-tables, and dig a well. From the United States to Chile and to Norway Brother Robert, Father Robert Kevin Anderson, is a monk of St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Abbey, Spencer, Massachusetts. He entered the Cistercian Order at the Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley back in 1949 when he was 17. He was one of the first choir novices professed after the community trans-ferred to Spencer. Frater Kevin, as he was called in those days, cared for the newly planted orchards and, after his ordination to the priesthood, for the newly planted brothers--as father master of the lay novices. But he had always experienced an attraction toward a more simple and radical form of monasticism. He went on to pursue this, first at St. Benedict\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monastery in the Colorado Rockies, then at the Monastery of Las Condes in the Chilean Andes. It was at the latter monastery that he first embarked on the eremitical life which he found to be his true calling. Later Father Robert sought deeper solitude in southern Chile\",\"but the bishop there had some ideas of his own about how Father was to lead the eremitical life. So Father moved on to the land of his family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s origins, Sweden. Here again, a hard-pressed bishop with few priests had his own ideas how a hermit-priest should live. And again Father moved, this time across the border to the diocese of the sympathetic and understanding Cistercian bishop, John Gran of Oslo. Until he could find a suitable site, Father Robert lived in a distant parish. Soon he found what seemed like an ideal place for a hermit: an island on Lake Tinn. But appearances can be deceiving. Living on an island meant dependence on others for all supplies, or keeping a boat for summer and an ice sleigh for winter. Then, too, the fine summer weather brought traffic to the lake. Father lifted up his eyes to the mountains, and soon ascended to Maria Einscete. The Hermit Life o| Father Robert Although feature articles and TV presentations have made Father Robert known throughout Norway and even throughout Scandinavia, he yet receives few visitors. The Norwegians respect and are inspired by his life of prayer and presence to God. They do not want to intrude. Besides, the ascent is difficult and the way known to few. The Catholic pastor, whose parish extends for several hundred miles, calls in from time to time. And of course, the good sisters find their way there at times\",\"also, the search-ing young--from as far away as south France or America. Priests have occasionally come for retreat. And a pious convert lives not far from Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mailbox and enjoys having him in to say Mass in her front room. A Norwegian Outpost: Maria Einscete / 273 But usually Bror Robert (as the Norwegians call him) is alone with his goats and his God. He goes down to the road to the mailbox every few days--and the owner of the neighboring box watches to see that the mail is collected, a sign that all is well with their hermit. Once a week or so, on skis in winter and a motor bike in summer, Father will go to the village for supplies. All the villagers know and love their hermit. They expressed real joy when \\\\\"Brother Robert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother\\\\\" came to visit him. From time to time Father goes to Oslo to speak to the Dominican nuns, the only con-templative community in Norway. And once a year he goes south to the French Abbey of Mont-des-Cats to see his spiritual father. This was one of the conditions the bishop placed on his presence in the diocese as a hermit: that once a year he would spend some time in a monastery. Father Robert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life is very simple. He prays the hours quite as they always have been celebrated in the monastery, and offers Mass for all man-kind. He does some wood carving, mounts ikons, and practices the ancient Norwegian craft of weaving baskets from birch roots. He also translates books. He is a gifted linguist and has mastered both new and old Nor-wegian, as well as the local dialect. These occupations, along with Mass stipends, help him to keep body and soul together. At the time of my first visit Father Robert had been living in his log cabin for about a year. The only facilities were the woods. He had dug a well nearby and so had plenty of good water. But he confessed to me that he spent most of his time during that first winter chopping firewood--for his cabin had no inner walls and was very difficult to heat. The Spencer community helped him then to get a logger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caravan, which is not only much more snug and easier to heat, but which Father was able to locate higher up on the mountain where he can benefit from much more sunshine. The view from the new location, looking out across Lake Tinn to Mount Gaustaf, one of the highest peaks in southern Norway, is simply magnifi-cent. As the rays of the sun play on clouds, mountains, lake, and forest one is ceaselessly awed. This is indeed a Godly place--an ideal place for a hermit. The Monastic Presence of Father Robert This extension of Spencer Abbey and of the American Cistercian Re--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gion, this foothold of Cistercian life in Norway, is certainly something for which we should be most grateful and praise the Lord. The effectiveness of Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monastic presence cannot be fully evalu-ated but it is certainly significant. This is rather surprising in a country where most are at best nominal members of a state church, and the few, very scattered Catholics tax the handful of devouted priests and religious who seek to minister to them. The latter, without exception, seemed to ad-mire and respect Father and find inspiration in his fidelity to his particular calling. But the Lutherans, too, revere him and seem to be grateful and 274 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 happy .that this man of God is in their midst. They relate stories of her-mits and monks who lived in this land before the Reformation and the Danish oppression, even of a particular hermit in the area of Lake Tinn. Even for these apparently religiously indifferent, ,the man of prayer living alone on the mountain is a sign of hope, of something better, higher, tran-scendent. And when the final option comes, hopefully, with perhaps only a vague and confused idea of what he stands for in their minds, and the grace flowing from his prayer in their hearts, they will reach out for that Transcendent Reality. Blessed be the Lord God . . . he has raised up a horn of salvation for Norway. Now that there is a Cistercian bishop and hermit, in Norway may we not soon have a regular cenobitic foundation? It is time the Cistercians returned. The Cistercians first directed their steps to Norway back in the twelfth century, in the Golden Age of the Order. And there are still significant remains ~of their presence. On the Island of HoevedCya in the Oslo Fjord, just a short ferryboat ride from the capital, are the ruins of an abbey founded in 1147 from Kirkstall,. The whole outiine of the regular build-ings is there. The walls of .the church reach up ten and fifteen feet, and higher at the comer tower. Through the insisterice of \\xe2\\x80\\x99Bishop Gran the government now preserves this site as a national monument. It is a very beautiful site indeed. But historical sites, no matter how beautiful, are not enough. The Church of Norway, like every other, needs for its fullness the presence of living and thriving contemplative communities. Guided by the Lord, Brother Robert has made a beginning. May the Lord prosper what he has begun. Reflections on Bangalore Sister Mary-John Mananzan, O.S.B. From October 14-22, 1973, the Second Asian Monastic Congress was held in Banga-lore, India. Sister Mary-John Mananzan, O.S.B., attended the meeting and gives here her impressions of the Congress. Sister Mary-John is Dean\",\"St. Scholastica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s College\",\"P.O. Box 3153\",\"Manila, Philippines. This will not be a report on the Bangalore Congress in the usual sense, but rather a reliving of significant experiences and a sharing of insights gained. No amount of faithful reporting can capture the atmosphere of such a meeting. But .perhaps the sharing of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impressions can give a glimpse into the dynamics of the ievent much more than a complete but detached description 9f the proceedings. Personalities Let me begin with the significant people who made an impression on me. Among the observers to the Congress were two Tibetan monks who rePr, ds.ehted thee Dalai Lama. They were Lama Sherpa Tulku and Lama Samdong Tulku. The one word that ke\\xe2\\x80\\x99eps coming to my mind to describe them is \\\\\"genuine.\\\\\" I was struck by their authenticity, their trueness to them-selves, their utter lack of pretense. They went about with serene dignity, quiet friendliness~ and unfailing self-mast6ry. They talked with perfect frankness about the problems of their people in exile with feeling but with-out the slightest rancor againsl~ the invading Chinese. And with disarming simplicity, one of them asked in our small group discussions: \\\\\"Please ex-plain to us what you mean by a personal God.\\\\\" The theological jar~gon did not seem to satisfy them, so during the coffee break I ventured an explana-tion which ran something like this: \\\\\"Lama Sherpa, do you sometimes talk to the Absolute Reality?\\\\\" 275 276 / Review [or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 \\\\\"Yes,\\\\\" he replied. \\\\\"Do you think he understands you?\\\\\" \\\\\"Yes.\\\\\" \\\\\"Well, that is more or less what we mean when we say that God is a person.\\\\\" He seemed to be more satisfied with this explanation. The lamas had a way of expressing their ideas in an unusually effective way. During the discussion on prayer Lama Samdong Tulku made the following remark: \\\\\"I.got the impression that when you pray, you send your words to the Absolute Reality. We, we push ourselves to It.\\\\\" Another personality which, for me, stood out, was Abbot Primate Rem-bert Weakland himself. He was a most excellent presiding officer\",\"more-over, his introductory and concluding talks showed his keen intelligence, his versatile scholarship, and his sobriety of judgment. He was most human. He joked with the seminarians of the Kristu Jyoti College where we stayed as though he were one of them but without losing his dignity. In fact I ob-served in him something I seldom observe in many superiors today--an unembarrassdd awareness of his authority and an unapologetic reference to it when he considered it useful to do so. Among the non-Asians who had adopted the Eastern way of monastic life, the one I considered most credible was Father Bede Griffiths. He went about in a most unobtrusive, unostentatious way without the slightest effort to edify or to preach. I find this significant because I felt that there can be a tendency among non-Asians who have insights about the indigenization of monastic life and liturgy which are in themselves authentic, to be over-zealous and therefore tactless in their efforts to conscienticize the people whose culture they have studied and adopted. I believe that there can be a very naive, uncritical adaptation to indigenous culture which, if cohpled with a lack of delicacy in strategy, could alienate the people because it ap-pears to them to be another and a subtler form of paternalism. When this is further accompanied by efforts to edify, then the people are positively repelled. Then one provokes reactions which may sound extreme and de-fensive, but are not wholly unjustified like: \\\\\"Why do they give themselves to be more Eastern than the Easterns?\\\\\" The adaptation of the Eastern forms of monasticism by monks and nuns in Asia is an important venture\",\"but this must be undertaken with utmost delicacy, tactful strategy, and with what perhaps for Westerners will amount to an almost intolerable amount of patience. I was enriched by the friendship with Vietnamese monks and nuns who shared with me their spiritual adventures. They have left their b!g monas-teries in the hillsides and have come to live among the poor in the center of the city of Saigon. The nuns take in laundry and typing work to support themselves and the monks take turns in tricycle driving. Reflections on Bangalore / 277 The Theme of the Congress The theme of the Congress was: \\\\\"The Experience of God.\\\\\" This was divided into subtopics .such as: Monastic Experience of God in Christianity and Other Religions\",\"The Experience of God: Methods of Realization\",\"The Experience of God in Community Life\",\"The Influence of Asiatic Religious on Monastic Structure\",\"The Experience of God and Social Responsibility\",\"and The Contribution of Christian Monasticism of Asia to the Universal Church. These were discussed in small groups as well as in the general assemblies. Again I will not make an effort to summarize the discussions but rather pick out those which had an impact on me. First of all, I regained my respect for the word \\\\\"monastic.\\\\\" Due to certain historical factors, the word \\\\\"monastic\\\\\" in certain circles had come to mean deportment, a pattern of behavior and a fuga mundi attitude. In the Congress, the main emphasis was on the single-minded search for God. There is a monastic dimension to every human being. For those who have come to an awareness orbit and who wish to fulfill this dimension of their being, there should be monastic communities whose structures are flexible enough to share their way of life even on a temporary basis. At this point, it is good to mention.what Bishop D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Souza expressed as the petition of the Indian hierarchy. The Indian hierarchy, he said, is asking the monastic communities to be: 1. eschatological signs (monks and nuns should primarily be men and women of God) 2. centers of liturgy 3. havens of serenity 4. examples Of simplicity of life and refinement 5. model communities for Christian living 6. houses of undiscriminating hospitality One thing that was realized in the Congress was the contribution that the non-Christian form of monasticism can give to the traditional Christian monastic\\\\\" life. There are several elements of the Eastern form of monasti-cism which have been forgotten or not emphasized enough in the Western tradition. There is, for example, the importance of the techniques and meth-ods in the search for the Absolute. The role of the body in prayer that is very much emphasized in Yoga and Zen could\\xe2\\x80\\x99be given the same impor-tance by Christian monks and nuns. The existential view of the Absolute and the unified view of reality of the East could balance the more con-ceptual and dualistic view of the West. The importance of the guru in Eastern spirituality can likewise revitalize the role of the spiritual director. Father Raymond Pannikar summarizes the unique role of the East thus: \\\\\"Just as Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to the Church is sensitivity to creation and that of the West,. the discovery of the value of history\",\"so the unique con-tribution of the Asian is to develop the dimension o] the spirit.\\\\\" 278 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 Shared Prayer The Congress was not just a series of intellectual discugsions on the experience of God: It was for many participants something of a spiritual experience in itself. Contributing tO these was, first, the shared liturgy which the different regional groups prepared, giving the ~vhole community an ex-perience of a variety of. indigenous liturgy \\\\\"Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese. There were likewise opportunities to meditate in the, Zen\\xe2\\x80\\x99 way, the Yoga way, the Tibetan Buddhist way, and in Christian shared prayers. Amid the variety of methods, ceremonies, symbols, \\xc2\\xb0and gestures there was the unity of hearts in worship.~And then there were the interpersonal en-counters which occasioned the sharing of spiritual experiences, the creating oLbonds which gave the promise of lasting friendships.~There was thus the wonder of discovery of the other in each other. There were no resolutions, conclusions, or statements at the end of the Congress. As Father Abbot Primate said, Bangalore was more humble in its tone than the Bangkok Congress. Its open-endedness is a challenge to further reflection and to further action. And this challenge was expressed in the delegates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 message to their communities which reads as follows: Message to Our Communities Together with Father Abbot Primate, Rembert Weakland, we, , gathered here at Bangalore for the Second Asian Monastic Congress, salute you with an Indian greeting:which echoes in our liturgy, SHANTI, PEACEF ,~ We would like to share with you the atmosphere of joy, openness and fraternity that prevails in this community, which grow out of peoples of dif-ferent backgrounds, not only of race and culture, but also of religious tradi-tion. We are fortunate to have at our meeting Cl~ri~tia\\xe2\\x80\\x99n monks and sisters of various countries, Tibetan lamas, Buddhist and Jain mdnks and Hindu swamis and sanyasis. We lived together, \\xe2\\x80\\x99praying and discussing in mutual enrichment. We are amazed to realize that, amid very real differences of opinions and experiences, there is an overwhelming convergence of concern: THE SINGLEMINDED SEARCH FOR GOD. It is in this conce.rn ~that we experience a strong bond of unity. We consider it our task as monks to commit ourselves wholehea.rtedly to this search, and it is in this context that we accept the world around us and feel h sense o.f sol!darity with it. We have a role in bt~iiding up the city of man. This consigts in pointing out to man the path to God. In particular, we are to share with the poor in theii-\\xc2\\xb0striving for human dignity and liberty. It has become clear to us that to realise these goals i.n our times calls for a radical openness.and flexibility in our religious life and structures. We are in a moment of challenge. If we fail to respond, we lose our right to exigt as monasteries. Your delegates will bring home to:you reports of the proceedihgs of the Congress. Understandably, these will kive but a glimpse into what really happened here. But, for many of us, this Congress has been a: real spiritual experience. ,.Your delegates can communicate this experience more effectively than any written .report. It is our earnest prayer that all the communities scattered throughout Asia will put into effect the insights gained during this Congress.. Tliis may mean breaking away from fixed patterns, settink out like Abraham ihto ff new land. Reflecffon~ on Bangalore / 279 We strongly recommend openness to our brothers of other religious traditions who, as we have experienced here, have so much to offer us. We urge the rethinking of our way of life so that as many people as possible may have the opportunity of sharing with us our experience of God within the content of living and vital communities. Let us maintain the bonds of unity which have been established among us through our delegates. During these days we have thought of you and prayed for you. May our continued unity in prayer be fostered by renewed contacts with one another. Toward a More Authentic Sharing in Community Laurent Boisvert, O.F.M. Father Laurent Boisvert, O.F.M., is the editor of the excellent Canadian magazine for religious, La vie des corntnunaut~s religieuses and lives at 5750, boulevard Rose-mont\",\"Montreal 410, Quebec\",\"Canada. The article originally appeared in the March 1973 issue of La vie des communaut~s religieuses and is printed in translation here with the authorization of that magazine. The translation was made by Sister Clarisse Marie, S.N.J.M.\",\"General Administration of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary\",\"187 Chemin de Cap-St.-Jacques\",\"Pierrefonds 940, P.Q.\",\"Canada. The sharing of material goods, based on the needs of each individual or moral person, tends to express and intensify the fraternal bond which unites us as religious. However, in everyday living this sharing meets with ob-stacles which compromise, in varying degrees, its fraternal character. A review of them will help us to become more conscious of them and so favor, I hope, the building of that community of justice, peace, and love which all of us desire and which alone can tnaly be called \\\\\"fraternal.\\\\\" It is not rare to hear religious ask themselves: How does it happen that our lives are so little changed by the many conferences, sessions, and work-shops in which we participate? These same religious insist that we present them not so much the fundamental values of religious life which they say they already know, but rather a way of integrating them into their lives. The reflections which follow relate to this first step: the \\\\\"how\\\\\" of living a more genuine fraternal community life, a step which consists in over-coming in oneself the chief obstacles to its realization. False Mental Attitudes When we insist, before community groups, that a distribution of goods 2110 Authentic Sharing in Community / 2111 be made according to the needs of each, some religious express amazement. It seems useless to them that we should come back to so fundamental an issue, and one that everyone accepts. No one can deny, however, that in spite .of acceptance in theory, certain religio.us, and a number sufficiently large to warrant the mentioning of it again, demand for themselves the use of all kinds of things, basing these requests, not on real need, but rather on the fact that other religious have and enjoy the use of. them. If someone has such and such a thing for his work, goes out so many times during the week, or wears clothing of such and such a quality, etc., others use the example of such religious to justify having the same things and acting in like manner. If one group needs two cars, another group made up of the same number of people will perhaps demand one, just because the first group has two, How can we explain this dichotomy between the theory of sharing goods according to need, and the contrary practice illustrated by the examples just given? The reason is, it seems to me, that the criterion for the distribution of goods, recognized at the intellectual level, has not yet penetrated the mentality of all religious nor modified their attitudes and their conduct. Certain religious accept the idea of pluralism in the forms of sharing, but their reactions are those of people accustomed to a uniform type of sharing. They still lack that which, for all of us, is most difficult to realize, namely a change of attitude. No modification of structures, how-ever radical, can dispense a religious from the effort required to bring.about this conversion. It is easier and faster to set up pluralistic structures for sharing than it is to transform a person accustomed to uniformity so that he becomes capable of understanding, of respecting and of favoring diversity on the level of persons and their needs, and of making the necessary applications. All of which helps us to understand that if, in our congregations, the adaptation of structures has in large measure been accomplished, the con-version of our ways of thinking has not. Some years of effort will still be necessary, years of patience and of tolerance, before the transformation of mental attitudes and of conduct becomes a reality. In spite of everything, some people will never know such a transformation, because they believe that such a change is an evil and not a benefit to be pursued. Charity re-quires that we respect them, and that we learn to live with them, in the wis-dom and great-heartedness of compromise which, under its\\xc2\\xb0 positive forms, is love. Inability to Estimate One\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Needs Accurately It is not sufficient to want to share a community of goods according to the real needs of each one. For the actual realization of this principle one must be able to evaluate tfiese needs honestly and accurately. Some religious are more or less incapable of making such an evaluation. For some, the reason lies in the formation they received as young religious and the long 2112 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 practice of a poverty based on dependence. They had only to ask and to leave ,to ,authority to judge the legitimacy of their request. Once the su-perior had given an affirmative answer, they never questioned themselves again about their use of the things granted. -This dependence,, judged in our day excessive, has atrophied the sense of responsibility\\\\\"of some and made them quite unable to determine their own needs: Today, when au-thority leaves them free to choose such and such a thing,, to do or not do such and such an. action, to go or not to go to such and such a place, they prefer no action at all rather then assume responsibility for it. Long and difficult will be,the liberating process which will one day enable them to judge their own needs, if~ such will ever be possible. ~ C-Certain religious, coming from poor families and having, lacked some of the basic necessities during their childhood, make up,for lost time and accumulate without reason a surplus of goods. They:even admit that they ask for things to make up for the lack of them experienced in the past..And so they fill their closets with items.for, which they have,no real need, but which give them a sort of psychological security. In this Way they com-pensate for the time when they sutIeredreal want. ~ ,, For other religious, the practice of a poverty consisting of going with-out, of detailed restriction for use\",\"of meticulous control and uniformity, has brought ab6ut another ,excessive reaction in that they,are constantly asking ..for things they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need and of which they never .seem to have enough. At the other extreme are those who considered this former practice of poverty the ideal one, and so refuse to accept any form of com-munal sharing based on a pluralism of real needs. Using False Criteria Again, for some religious, the relative incapacity of identifying their real needs results from the use of false criteria. They will say, in, order to justify a trip: all my brothers and,sisters went to such aoplace, though an-other might say~ with just as much truth: I cannot make that .trip since none of my brothers and sisters have ever been there. Can the single fact :that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relatives have visited Europe constitute a ,valid reason for asking for a trip overseas? Or again, can the simple fact that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents have never taken:~some scenic trip within the province or state:~be sufficient reason for denying oneself ,such an outing? In both cases, the use .of the \\\\\"family\\\\\" norm, instead of helping, hinders the discovery of real needs. That one consider the situation of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family is certainly not wrong, but to use it as the sole means of defining orie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Own needs and the ~type of relaxation one has a right to seek is certainly without justification. These .conclusions apply .likewise .to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social and professional posi-tion. There are people who count on the life style of ~this double milieu to determine personal needs. If they: live inca neighborhood where~each family averages one or two color-television~, sets, a summer cottage\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a snowmobile Authentic Sharing in Community / 2113 or~ two, etc., they think that they too have a right to these same things and wi!l use them, under the illusion that they are living their commitment to po~verty.,lf th~ey work in the.~schools or hospitals and if the majority~of their companions go to Florida every year, wear a new outfit every day, etc., they come to believe that such is Lequired of them too, and in their minds these things become necessities that must be satisfied. The fallacy .of such ~rea.soning comes,from the setting up of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s .social or professional sur-roundings as an absolute ~in determining personal needs. It ought to be evi-dent that even if all the teachers of the school have a car, and if all the families in the area have two television sets, I do not necessarily need the same things. It also ha.ppens that this met.hod of evaluating needs ac.cord-ing to a social or professi0nal milieu soon involves various forms of dis-crimination, ail.harmf.ul to .the ,building of a fraternal community. Let us add that economy, valid as it may be, often prejudices one?s judgment of personal needs. To know how to economize is a quality that most people of average means acquire through\\xc2\\xb0 force of circumstances, That religious should possess, it is nother surprising nor embarrassing..\",\"Waste-fulness and .extravagance, as well as carelessness, have always been,.con-sidered faults. The error, in the case of the religious, is to purchase things, not because ~one may need them, but because they are on sale and that per-haps one day they will be useful. It is also true that this intention of econo-mizing has a way of multiplying needs. The Influence of Numbers ,, In visiting a number of local commu~nities I ~have ~liscovered that re-ligious in small groups have their real needs satisfied much more easily than do religious in..larger gr.oups: Although not universal, this situation is repre-sentativ, e of a number of congregations. Of course, there are many cases in which it is reasonable and necessary \\xc2\\xaf to take numbers, into consideration. For example, if the local authority in a community of one hundred persons is planning an outing which includes transportation and lunch~ it is obvious that one must consider the number of those who wish to participate. The influence of numbers can, however, become harmful to community sharing when., a particular type .of logic prevails as sometimes happens in larg~ groups, though it. may also be found in more restricted ones, too. For example, two or three religious.desire to obtain skis in order to satisfy.a real need for relaxation, so they go to the local authority with their req.uest only to receive this answer: I cannot authorize such an expenditure\",\"just think of the money involved if the sixty religious of the house were to come asking for skis! This reasoning characterizes a mentality which cerl~ainly is not pluralistic ,\\xe2\\x80\\x99and which fails to respect personal needs. That two or three religious desire some skis in no way implies that all the others need or even wish them. The falseness of this reasoning is even more evident Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 when we realize that the community is made up for the most part of older people or of those who are ill. On pushing this kind of logic to the extreme, one ought to refuse a wheelchair to a sick person who really needs one because everyone else might want one too. This type of reasoning may also exist among some members of the community group. They refrain from asking for what they really need be-cause they say: If everybody were to ask for such a thing, the community could not afford it. However, it is nowhere written that all the religious of a house must have the same needs at the same time, and that to satisfy them one must buy sixty canes or sixty wigs at the same time! Why, then, should we suppose this uniformity and always act in view of the total num-ber? Wherever this kind of logic dominates, whether on the part of the superior or of the members of the group matters little, it makes impossible the practice of community sharing according to need. The Moral Weight of Salaries The religious earning a high salary seems to have a special facility for getting what he needs and often more than he needs, while the one who makes no financial contribution is sometimes too embarrassed to make known real needs. Other variants of this phenomenon are these: The re-ligious in a salaried service who works overtime may think it his right to keep and to use as he pleases at least a part of the extra money so earned\",\"the one who has won a grant or money award will not fail to exploit his chance of obtaining favors\",\"the religious who receives an \\\\\"old-age pension\\\\\" and the one who regularly draws some form of income may also use these to obtain personal advantages. The moral weight of money earned by a religious\\xe2\\x80\\x99 likewise risks in-fluencing the decisions of the superior. Does he feel as free and no more obligated in evaluating the requests of the one who hands in a substantial check than he does in judging those requests made by members who make no such contribution? It would not be surprising if, in the first case, he finds a particular facility in saying \\\\\"yes\\\\\" at once and with a smile, while in the second case, he has a tendency to ask questions about the necessity of the items requested and to multiply his reflections on the observance of poverty. In allowing a lapse of time between turning in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s check and making a request for what one judges useful or necessary, the religious can help those in authority to avoid showing favor and granting to him as to the others only what he really needs. At the provincial level we occasionally see this tendency in operation in those cases in which authority tends to discriminate between local groups of varying incomes. Groups with significant revenues sometimes receive more easily the authorization for extra expenditures than another poorer group, though the actual needs of the two groups may be identical. If such is the case, it is evident that discrimination is practiced in dealing with local Authentic Sharing in Community / 285 groups, a situation very detrimental in the realization of a truly fraternal community. The Matter o~ Gi~ts It also happens that the reception of gifts sometimes prevents sharing according to need. The religious, benefiting from the generosity of family or friends, is often better provided for than the one who must depend solely on the community. In order to justify the keeping or the use of things received, the religious reasons that he got them gratuitously when he ought rather to be motivated by real need. If our poverty permits us to accept gifts, they must nevertheless be used for all without discrimina-tion. This means that the religious may not have more because he receives more, but that all needs be judged by the same standard and that all be treated in the same manner. Whether the .goods to satisfy our needs comes from within or from outside the community is of lesser consequence. Two other observations must be made here in regard to gifts. Certain religious still declare that the refusal of anything offered to them by their parents, friends, or others, always constitutes a failure against poverty, indeed an injustice to the congregation. As it stands, this statement is inaccurate. The refusal of certain goods offered is sometimes required by our commitment to poverty. Such is the case when an individual or moral person does not need that which is offered, and in addition, the donor re-fuses any transfer of his gift. Such is likewise the case when, in response to a real need, a religious is offered something which can in no way be justified by the norms of simplicity. The second observation bears on the \\\\\"intention of the donor.\\\\\" The intention clearly expressed by the donor does not suppress or replace the authorization required for the keeping and the use of goods. A religious cannot go to Europe simply because his parents have given him~the money for the trip. If competent authority refuses him\\\\\" the permission and if the intention of the parents about the destination of their gift remains fixed, there is nothing left for the religious to do but to refuse or to return the money. However, in the majority of cases, it is not necessary to be scrupulous about respecting the intention of the donor. Many people offer us small gifts (the notion of \\\\\"small\\\\\" varies considerably, of course) and say to us: This is for you, for your personal needs, clothing, recreation, etc. If we took the time to explain our way of life to them as a community sharing a common fund, they would probably be quite happy to allow one of our companions to benefit from their generosity..Though we rarely explain this to them, we can ordinarily, without any qualms of conscience, pre-sume their understanding acceptance and put in the common fund what-ever we receive. 2116 / Revie.w for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 On the contrary, the intention of the \\xc2\\xb0donor must be respected when the gift is made in the form of an inheritance or legacy. Let us make clear, however, that the religious to whom these goods have been offered alway~ has the right to refuse them. He even has the duty to do so in a case in which the, acceptance of an inheritance or legacy, involves obligations ~otaily or partially in violation of his religious 9ommitments. We must also understand that. authority does sometimes have a word to say in our ac-ceptance or refusal of such goods. The Moral Weight of Competence, Position, and Conduct In this matter of sharing, the professional status of religious some-times operates in his favor. Experience shows that in certain cases the religious~ ,possessing special qualifications obtains what he needs more easily than does his confrere who lacks such competence\",\"he may even receive a ~urplu~ while the other is deprived of basic necessities. We have no intention of condemning competence\",\"but under pain of closing our eyes to reality, we must acknowledge that this competence does sometimes exercise a moral influence on those presenting their needs, inclining them to ask for more than they really need. It may also influence those whose role is to insure .a just distribution of material resources in their application of the principle of real need. Experience0shows us that a past office may become another pretext for keeping and us_ing certain goods. The religious whose work required a specialized library, for example, may have a strong inclina.tion to keep it even after he no longer occupies the position which once required it. The one who needed a car for his work will be tempted to continue to keep it even after he is transferred to another office which in no way requires its use. Certain personal itnd marginal benefits connected with having a car make it very .painful for him to give it up. Again it may happen that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present position Fay serve as an oc-casion for the granting or obtaining.of favors either for self or for others. Thus a superior, as soon as he is named,.,may ask for a ~\\xe2\\x80\\x99oom with a bath attached. Is this to help him fulfill his office\\\\\"moi\\xe2\\x80\\x99e efffctively? Is such an installation really needed for his work? If not, how can he justify requesting it for himself while refusing it to others. It is no more justifiabl~ for a superior to use the pretext of his office to receive and to keep as long as he wishes all the magazines that come to the house. How can one approve such action? If he were in charge of formation and if, with the consent of the community or of authority, he had a prior right or even exclusive right to the use of a magazine published for formation personnel, nobody would complain. But no one can accept, and with reason, that an individual in virtue of his office, keep for himself as long as he likes the newspapers and magazines :meant for the use of all. Such practice is an obstacle to fraternal sharing. The one whose function Authentic Sharing in Community is to build community ought to be the first to ~remove from his own life anything that might compromise it. Let me add as a last moral influence a particular type of conduct in which a few religious indulge when making a request to authority. Their tone, gestures, and manner in general can be so high-handed that it be-comes almost impossible for the superior to refuse, even when he judges superfluous the object requested. When dealing with such persons he per-haps says to himself: It is easier to grant them what they want at once than to put up with the endless scenes and references to the matter that they will make if it is denied them. The superior may even justify his action by saying that he consented in \\\\\"order to avoid a greater evil. All the same, that will not prevent those in the community from believing that at times a dif-ficult disposition does get results. While we understand the delicate posi-tion of authority in these instances, we must also recognize that such con-duct on the part of a member of the group can be an obstacle to fraternal sharing as it prevents the application of the principle: each according to need. The Influence of Social Convention According to current styles and in varying degrees, social convention may also influence both the religious in determining his needs, and the su-perior whose role is to assure that fraternal dimension of communal shar-ing proper to a religious household. Ordinarily we find it easier to ask for those things~ accepted by social convention than for those outside it. The superior in turn has a tendency to authorize more quickly those things it approves than those which are indifferent or contrary, to it. In this way social convention sometimes exerts a destructive influence on the charitable quality which ought to characterize our sharing from a common fund ac-cording to individual needs. . In considering the influence of social convention on religious, it cer-tainly explains at least in. part their attitude toward smoking, for example. The religious who smokes normally receives the necessary tobacco even though the expense occasioned ma~, be as high as two or three hundred dollars a year. The need to smoke, createdand developed by him, no longer requires critical evaluation but is taken for granted\",\"and when the com-munity budget is prepared, there is no hesitation about\\xe2\\x80\\x99setting aside im-portant sums for it. ~ : It is not at all,certain, on the other h~nd, that the philatelist would so easily be allotted a similar sum for the purchas.e of new stamps. How does it happen that we consent so easily to satisfy the needs of the one who smokes but refuse those of the stamp collector? The pressure of social con-vention would seem to be the exp!anation. Under pain of being considered out of step with the times, religious cannot ignore social convention completelyi but by conforming to it with- 2811 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 out discrimination they can create needs the satisfaction of which amounts to real slavery and causes surprise and even scandal to others. Religious ought to be free enough, for example, in the matter of dress to avoid mak-ing an absolute of an outmoded costume and to consider relative those fashions which social convention seeks to impose on them everyday. This relativity can be expressed in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice of classic styles, simple and few in number, and much less subject to frequent and costly change than those passing fads which are here today and forgotten tomorrow. If it is normal for religious to be aware of social usage and to observe it when in their exterior relations they judge it necessary or useful, they must make the necessary effort to prevent it from entering so deeply into their lives as to create an endless chain of new needs. Let it suffice to men-tion the use of alcoholic drinks. Rare are those social functions, meals, and evenings from Which these are absent. If the religious is not on his guard, in multiplying his social relationships, he risks developing an acute need for alcohol. In this case, satisfaction can never be regarded as liberation, but rather a most insidious form of personal slavery. A Lack of Empathy Lack of empathy is particularly noticeable on those occasions when a religious must submit to a superior or to other members of his group his personal needs in view of an evaluation or control. It may happen that one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first reaction is to make comparisons with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own needs, forgetting that each one is unique and therefore different\",\"And so the superior says: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why you want to buy this secular outfit\",\"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99~ wear one and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never suffered from not doing so. Or again: I never went to hear such and such a singer\",\"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see what advantage you can get out of an evening so spent. Such a person never tries to put himself in the position of the one asking in order to be better able to understand his needs. He seeks rather to impose his own values on the other person or again to convince him that he does not have such a need because as superior he himself never experienced it. Without exactly realizing it, the superior may set himself up as a sort of prototype whom the others would profit by imitating. In following this sort of logic, ought he not require others to be hungry at the same time he is and with the same intensity, to be sleepy when he is, and to require the same number of hours of sleep? People incapable of this empathy are quite unable to evaluate the needs of others. We might as well say at the same time that they do not know how to exercise the service of authority, since they will never be able to understand those whom they are supposed to help. They may think they understand others, but as a matter of fact they understand only that which they can project on others. In general the person with little empathy is intolerant, not through ill will, but through his inability to put himself Authentic Sharing in Community / 2119 in the position of others. In wishing them well, he may even impose on them things that may cause them serious harm. Exclusive or Prior Right to Use The use of certain equipment may be necessary for a religious in the fulfillment of his office. It is considered essential for his work and he could not give it up without compromising the task confided to him. Such usage is valid and his confreres readily accept his use of what is neces-sary\",\"but if they see that he has reserved for his exclusive use things for which he has no real need, at least at certain times, feelings of discontent-ment and a sense of injustice are not slow in surfacing. An example will help to make my point clear. Let us suppose that my work requires the use of a car quite regularly. On the days when I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to make any trips, those times when I travel by plane, am I going to lock up the car when I could just as well let others use it? If I put the car in the garage and the keys in my pocket, and if I force my com-panions to take the bus for their trips when the use of a car would be much appreciated and a real convenience for them, can I say sincerely that I am living the principle of fraternal sharing? In order to justify my conduct, I can no doubt find many reasons: A car is something one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lend to just anybody\",\"I must keep the things I need for my work in good condition\",\"no one knows how to take care of them as I do\",\"it is often a costly business to lend one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equipment\",\"thb community has other cars for general use\",\"etc. Underneath these reasons, all of which contain some element of truth, there is perhaps another which I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t admit: an undue attachment which makes me a slave of this thing. Deep down I prefer its safekeeping to communion with my brothers. In fact, my refusal to put the car at their disposition, far from favoring inter-personal relations, risks destroying them altogether and setting up barriers which are difficult to break down. If, after such conduct, I dare to repeat that goods should be oriented toward the well-being of the group and the strengthening of mutual relations, I must admit that in practice I sub-ordinate persons to things. If in my work, instead of this exclusive right to the use of equipment, I exercise what may be called a prior right to its use, I will quickly come to realize to what degree this type of use and the mentality which it de-velops favor fraternal union. Nobody denies that there are certain incon-veniences in this kind of sharing, that one risks finding one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s things out of order, not in the same condition as one left them, etc. However, be-fore committing myself to sharing, ought I wait until no such risks are involved? If so, I mi~ght just as well say categorically that I refuse to share. Of course, everyone recognizes the existence of an occasional case when it would be better to keep one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tools exclusively for personal use. Such exceptions, however, do not modify the general rule according to 290 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 which the religious ought to exercise a prior right rather than an exclusive one to the use of those things necessary for the accomplishment of his duties. The first recognizes and favors fraternal sharing, while the second usually cuts it off abruptly. The Proprietor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mentality Every religious making use of community goods can say, and he has reason: This property belongs to me\",\"it has been put at my disposition by a moral person called the \\\\\"province\\\\\" or \\\\\"institute.\\\\\" He may be inclined per-haps, in ~order to justify his poverty before those who do not believe in it anymore, to exaggerate the inconveniences of such a situation and to keep silent about the advantages which it affords. Sometimes he will even cover up his possessive attitude with regard to certain things saying that they do not belong to him and therefore he cannot lend them. Under pain of deny-ing the evidence, we must admit that some religious seem to have a pro-prietor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentality with regard to goods belonging to the province or in-stitute. Such a mentality is an obstacle to fraternal sharing. If, in order to illustrate my idea, I use the community treasurer as an example, it is not that this mentality is more widespread among them than among other religious, but because frequent reference is made to them when this topic is discussed. In fact, it often happens that the treasurer acts as if he were the proprietor of the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goods. He feels free to ask ques-tions, even indiscreet ones, about the sums of money requested, while actu-ally it is his business simply to hand over what has been authorized. He scolds others for expenditures which he has no right to judge. He may even insist on an itemized account which normally is given to the superior. When he gives out money, his gesture is marked by a pained expression as if part-ing with it hurt him physicallly. If we describe it at its worst, we might say that in keeping the purse-strings, he seems to keep the whole community on a,.leash. This caricature, although rough!y drawn, is not entirely the fruit of the imagination. If I have exaggerated some situations, I have reproduced others with an accuracy that no one can deny. It is not surprising if religious, subjected to caprices of this kind, no longer dare ask the community even for what is necessary, but arrange to obtain it outside, or keep a part of their salary or gifts received, in order to satisfy their needs. The changing of the name \\\\\"procurator\\\\\" to \\\\\"economist,\\\\\" \\\\\"treasurer,\\\\\" \\\\\"controller,\\\\\" or whatever, does not remedy the evil. The real problem is not one of vocabulary, but of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way of thinking, and it is this that must be changed. The bursar must recognize, in theory and in practice, that the property confided to his administration belongs to the community., that his task consists in managing it with competence, and in distributing it amiably to religious whose needs have been approved by authority. His office must not be the scene of daily contention, but rather a place where love operates under the guise of both gift and welcome. Authentic Sharing in Commitnity / Let me express sincere appreciation to all those religious who fill their post as treasurer with competency, interior detachment, and in a spirit of service. Everyone knows that theirs is often a thankless task, and one we could not do without. In accomplishing it with that joy and tact which love knows how to exercise, they can do much towards the realization of the ideal of fraternal sharing according to the real needs of each one. Fear, Embarrassment, Shame, Scruples in Regard to Asking Strange as it may appear, there are still some religious who are unable to express their real needs, who prefer to deprive themselves of what they need rather than ask for it. These religious, either by temperament or for-mation, have developed in themselves a fear, an embarrassment, shame, or even scruples about asking. Among them are those who are not earning, and on this account dare not mention their needs. Some of them think of themselves as a burden to the community. While helping these religious to free themselves from whatever prevents them\\\\\" from asking for what they need, authority must take the initiative, offering them and even giving them whatever they may need. If this is considered an exaggeration, it is better to fail on the side of kindness and attention than on that of indifference and privation. It is always easier to notice the people who abuse than those whom we abuse. There also exists on the part of some a certain shame and embarrass-ment about asking which may be the result of our manner of community living and sharing in the past. I understand the uneasiness of those of thirty, forty, fifty, and more who still ask local authority or the treasurer for stamps, letter-paper, tooth-paste, soap, etc., but such a practice of com, munity sharing can no longer be justified in the name of poverty. Though long since outmoded, it has not yet totally disappeared. In my opinion it would be so much simpler, so much more adult and reas6nable, to put all these things for common use in a place where each one could take what he needs as he needs it. It is useless to complain of possible abuse in order to refuse such an elementary practice. The existence of such abuse is inevitable, whatever the manner of living the principle of common sharing. Would it not be better that the abuses accompany an adult practice of sharing instead of a childish and embarrassing one? In conclusion on this point let me say that one of the gravest abuses of the practice of religious poverty is that form of dependence which encourages and even develops personal irresponsi-bility. The Application of Various Formulas for Sharing Though there are several formulas for the sharing of go~ds, I do not in-tend here to present the advantages and inconveniences of each. I wish only to point out that the manner of applying any valid formula is able to trans-form it into an obstacle to fraternal sharing. Take for example the individual 292 / Review ]or Religious, F\\xe2\\x80\\x99olume 33, 1974/2 budget. It is, for religious in general, a practical manner for determining needs and when approved, of receiving whatever is necessary to meet them. This does not mean, however, that such a formula is best for all the religious of an institute, or of a province, or of a local community. There are some people who find a personal budget more of a useless bother than a help in practicing religious poverty. Why impose it on them then? On the other hand, why forbid it to the rest of the community just because some do not find it helpful? In ~. word, fraternal sharing is not free when the individual budget is refused or imposed on all alike. In those communities in which, in order to respect personal needs, the community budget is made obligatory and the individual budget optional, uniformity may compromise the quality of fraternal sharing. As regards the community budget it is rare, thanks be to God, to hear people use the argu-ment of uniformity to obtain more, to grant or to refuse permission. Wherever uniformity is the sole criterion for making requests or granting authorization, fraternal charity in the treatment of local groups is often ignored. Though two communities may be made up of the same number of persons, it does not follow that the needs of one be identical to the needs of the other. To respect each group in its uniqueness requires ordinarily both diversity and plurality in the manner of treatment. It is the same for individuals. How can anyone justify uniformity in the amount of money granted annually to religious who make use of a budget? Let us take the matter of clothing, for example. The one who is small and well-built will surely have an advantage over another less well-proportioned, with bulges here and there, not to mention fiat feet! Some would remedy this situation by asking that the first person hand in what he has left over, and that the second ask for what he still needs. However, one must admit that the latter remains in an awkward position as it is always harder to ex-tend the hand to receive than to turn in a surplus. In the end, would it not be simpler and more charitable to leave each one free to evaluate his cloth-ing needs and to ask for the money necessary to take care of them. The individual budget plan by which a uniform lump sum is given to all religious also presents, in actual practice, certain facets detrimental to fraternal sharing. Let us suppose that each religious of a local community receives $2500 annually, and that it is left to him to allocate this sum as he sees fit. Such procedure risks creating unjustifiable inequality. Religious whose parents live a few miles away will spend very little to goto see them regularly, while another having parents living at a distance, can visit them only rarely and under pain of seriously jeopardizing his budget. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this a form of discrimination? Another weakness inherent in this plan is that the religious who can economize will manage to procure all sorts of valuable objects (record-play-ers, tape-recorders, etc.) and will have the clear impression, even the con- Authentic Sharing in Community / 293 viction, that these belong to h, im. Of course, he will feel free to take them with him on changing residenc~. As a last obstacle to fraternal sharing, let me add the refusal a priori of approving several different plains and allowing them to be used within the local community as the memlSers judge best. One would respect individual needs more surely if some wer~ permitted to use an individual budget, while others were given an allowan+e for expenses, and still others received the money necessary as the need arose. There are some very deserving religious who do not have any use for a~ individual budget or for a regular allowance and who desire to continue to~ practice poverty by asking for things as they need them. We violate the fraternal quality of our sharing if we impose on them a plan which burdens rather than frees them in their service of God. Conclusion The practice of fraternal sfiaring to which we are bound bestows on our I . community of goods its evangehcal and religious significance. Indeed, it is in order to strengthen the fraiernal bond which unites us and to express it before the world that we have chosen to put all our possessions into a com-mon fund, and to share them according to the real needs of each one. The obstacles that this sharing mebts in practice prove that it is difficult for all of us, because of our sinful condition, to observe perfectly that which we desire with all our hearts. However, the rehg~ous who recognizes the diffi-culties and makes an effort to leliminate them from his life, demonstrates his faith in those values for whic~ the fraternal community stands and his de-sire to collaborate construct~ve, ly in building it, depending on the support of Jesus Christ, thecenter of oui\\\\\" lives, for a more perfect realization of it. The General Chapter of Affairs Joseph F. Gallen, S.J. Joseph F. Gallen, S.J., a specialist !n canon law for religious, writes from St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99.s Church: 321 Willing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Alley\",\"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106. Pre-chapter Preparation : Pre-chapter preparation, despite its evident need, was almost univer-sally unknown before post-Vatican II general and provincial chapters. The delegates\\xe2\\x80\\x99to the general chapter should be elected hbout a year before the assehably of the chapter. This will make it possible to have the pre-chapter committees constituted predominantly of chapter members from the begin-ning. The superior general and his council, or a committee appointed by him, could have already inaugurated the work by securing the proposals from the members of the institute and having them arranged according to subject matter. These could be given almost immediately to the pre-chapter committees. The delegates may be elected earlier than a date determined in the constitutions, e.g., six months before the assembly of the chapter. This determination of time is a very accidental aspect of the law, and a rea-sonable cause excuses from it. The more fundamental content of such a law is to elect the delegates at a time that will give the best possible preparation for the chapter. I think myself that a committee of more than five is gener-ally less efficient. If the quantity of the work so demands, several parallel or sub-committees can be designated. As many as possible of those on a com-mittee should be competent in the field of the committee. Each institute should know from its experience of recent chapters and from the problems now facing it just what committees are needed. There should be a steering or co-ordinating committee. Other committees have been on the religious life, vows, constitutions, government, liturgy, formation, apostolate, finances, 294 The General Chapter o] Affairs / 295 retirement, and habit. Canon law has no legislation on committees. There-fore, it depends on the particular institute to determine the committees and their work\",\"the members and chairpersons may be elected or appointed or be designated partially by both election and appointment\",\"the chairpersons may be elected by the members of the particular committee. Manner of Pre-chapter Committee Preparation The one directing the pre-chapter preparation gives the proposals or chapter matter to the chairpersons of the pertinent committees, who in turn distribute them to the individual members of the committees to ~work up, dividing the matter as evenly as possible. Let us suppose that the following proposal has been assigned to an individual of the government committee: the term of office of the superior general should be reduced from six to five (four) years, with only one immediate re-election permitted. The committee member is to work up a report on this proposal in the manner of a secretary, an objective researcher, not as a supporter or antag-onist of the proposal or as a policy maker. The chapter makes the decision on enactments and policy, not the committee. The first thing the committee member does is to write down the number of the proposal, if these are num-bered. Identical and almost identical proposals are to be treated together on the same report. The committee member therefore next notes on the report the number that submitted it, for:example: 36 handed in this proposal for a five and 15 for a four year term. He then expresses the proposal in one statement or in parts but both in such a way as to permit a yes-no discussion and a yes-no decision. He next, under the heading~of sense, gives any ex-planations of the proposal, always being complete throughout the report but as ~clear and brief as possible. Submitted proposals, are almost, always wordier and more obscure than the example given above, but the term \\\\\"im-mediate\\\\\" in the example above could be briefly explained. He could well conclude the section on sense by a statement such as the following: The pi\\xe2\\x80\\x99oposal contains two ideas, a five (four) instead o1~ a\\\\\"six year term andonly one immediate re-election. The heart of his report is in the following sec-tion, in which he gives all~ the reasons for and then all the reasons against the proposal, noting when any of these reasons has greater weight for or against the four than the five year term. He ends the report with his recom-mended decision: to be accepted, to be rejected, to be accepted with modi-fications. It is evident that the reasons for the acceptance or rejection are the favorable or unfavorable reasons he has already listed. He should add his reasons for suggesting modifications. Copies of this report are distributed to all the committee members. They are to be given adequate time for its study. When a sufficient number of reports are ready, they are to be dis-cussed in a committee meeting. The committee confirms, rejects in whole or in part, and corrects the report of the individual member, which thus becomes the committee report. The committee vote on the report and its :296 / Review for Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 distinct parts should be included on it, e.g., 3 for, 2 against. Reports for all the proposals to be discussed in any period of sessions should be ready be-fore that period begins. These should be distributed to the capitulars at least on their arrival so that they can be properly studied. The failure to have such reports is a primary cause for the many unreflecting, inefficient, and slow general chapters we have had in the post-Vatican II years. Any religious experienced in chapters should see the need of reports of the type described above. They are demanded by evident facts. The primary such fact is that a chapter should make its decisions from convictions based on solid reasons. This will certainly not be attained unless there is a thorough investigation and study of the facts and reasons. It is also a sufficiently evident and most pertinent fact that many of the capitulars will not study the proposals beforehand. The reports will help to lessen their uninformed voting. Many capitulars will not be able to understand some proposals with-out such a report, for example, those who have had no experience in han-dling large sums of money can find financial proposals difficult to understand, and a religious who has not been in the novitiate since he left it thirty years ago will find. many ideas on formation most difficult to grasp. Proposals handed in by chapter members during the chapter should be processed through the pertinent committee in the manner described above. Subject Matter of the General Chapter of Affairs The norm of the practice of the Holy See for this has been the more im-portant matters that concern the entire institute. If the matter is not more important or does not concern the entire institute, it appertains to the ordi-nary government of the general, provincial, or local superiors. In the con-crete this matter has consisted of the proposals submitted by the members, provincial chapters, and the general capitulars during the time of the general chapter. The first observation is that the proposals under one aspect can readily be insufficient. Almost universally the proposals on a particular matter do not touch, at least adequately, all the more important aspects, difficulties, and problems of the particular field. Quite often they are concerned only with its accidental and lesser aspects. Very frequently also the admittance of a proposal will demand as a consequence or antecedently presume another proposal which has not been submitted. In all such cases, the pertinent com-mittee should add the required proposals, noting on each its committee source and the reasons why it was submitted by the committee. It is not very intelligent to have the submitted proposals as the subject matter, with-out designating anyone to point out and supply for the omissions and the lack of balance. In such a system, it can be almost a mere accident that the general chapter faces all the real problems of the institute. There has to be a way of rejecting very expeditiously the proposals that are less important and general or otherwise evidently inadmissible. Each The General Chapter of Affairs / 297 committee should list all such proposals submitted to it, and very early sub-mit this list to the co-ordinating committee. The latter should go over the lists and have them duplicated and distributed to the chapter members. Sufficient time should be granted for the proper study of the lists, and the chapter is then to be asked to reject all of them in the one vote. The per-mitted recourse against rejection should be of the following type. If a capitu-lar, not the one who submitted the proposal as such, believes that any such rejected proposal is worthy of a committee report and chapter discussion, he should hand in this proposal with his reasons for its repeated presenta-tion. The verdict on confirming or rescinding the rejection should not be made by the original rejecting committee but by the co-ordinating com-mittee. This will avoid having the same committee as both judge and de-fendant in the recourse. Greater Reduction of Matter Is Necessary The reduction of the work of the general chapter has to be much greater than the mere immediate rejection of proposals considered less important, less general, or otherwise evidently inadmissible in the past. No general chapter can s.atisfactorily handle a thousand or two thousand proposals. This is true even if the pre-chapter prepa.ration is most thorough and com-plete, The number of proposals that confronted very many post-Vatican II general chapters was prostrating. Nor is it sensible to think of more fre-quent general chapters\",\"we have too many now. Not a great number of them have been religiously effective, and there is nothing in multiplication that augurs greater effectiveness. Perhaps the remedy is to cut down very severely the work of the general chapter to the particular matters that are very highly important and urgent and to give much greater attention to policies than to enactments and changes of enactments and laws in particular matters. Present Mentality Few will now even question the statement that we are faced by a crisis of authority. Pope Paul VI has often spoken~ of this crisis, for example: To mention another: there is the excessive emphasis on the right of the indi-vidual to do as he pleases, which leads to the rejection of any and all limits imposed from without and of any and all authority, however legitimate it may be (May 25, 1968, The Pope Speaks, 13 [1968], 222). In this way a mentality is spread which would like to claim that dis-obedience is legitimate and justified in order to protect the freedom that the sons of God should enjoy (January 29, 1970, ibid., 15 [1970], 54). Since therefore it is a visible society, the Church must necessarily have the power and function of making laws and seeing to it that they are obeyed. The Church\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members in turn are obliged in conscience to observe these laws (December 13, 1972, ibid., 17 [1973], 376). This mentality of hostility tO authority and law is one of the very im-portant and urgent matters that a general chapter must face and strive to 2911 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 change, but it is also a fact that makes one question the enactment of many laws at present. Matters Excluded from the Competence of General Chapters Possessing Experimental Authority These chapters obviously cannot change ( 1 ) divine law, whether natural or revealed\",\"(2) and without the previous appro\\xe2\\x80\\x99~al of the Sacred Congrega-tion for Religious and Secular Institutes these chapters may not put into effect anything that is contrary to the common law (canonical prescriptions, laws of Vatican II, and other laws and decrees of the Holy See)\",\"nor (3) make any change in the purpose, nature, and characteristics of any institute or in the Rule of an institute (Ecclesiae sanctae, n6. 6). Proposals These are made by the members of the institute and by provincial chap-ters. All are to be encouraged to make proposals\",\"all are equally to be counseled to make only good proposals, and this means good for the entire institute. A proposal is to be judged by its content, but an obscure and un-duly long proposal is a certain indication of insufficient thought. The insuffi-ciency in this: case frequently extends to the content of the proposal. To find l~roposals a religious, should go over the life of the individual members and of,the community immediately with God, the community life, and the life of work. He should go through all pertinent books, e.g., the constitutions. He is to evaluate and to find ways to correct and improve the life of sanc-tity, the apostolate, the present policies and trends of the institute, its public image in the Church and in.general. He should evaluate, all innovations of the post-Vatican II years. Have they succeeded, failed, and in each case to what extent? Have the members of the institute become better religious, better participants in the community life, better apostles? What are the big problems facing the institute today? What is their solution? What is the re-ligious\\xe2\\x80\\x99 effectiveness of superiors, their councilors, those in charge of forma-tion, of the works of the al:iOstolate? Is the tenor and style of life in the houses conducive to the religious life, the apostolate, a religiously satisfy-ing community life? Are your proposals solid, progressive without being im-prudent? Do they all propose freedom from something that is difficult and demands sacrifice? Proposals must be signed only and to the extent that this is com-manded by the law of the institute. A final day, well ahead of the opening of the general chapter, must be determined for the handing in of proposals. All, including general capitulars, should hand in their proposals during this tim& The general capitulars retain the right of making proposals during the chapter: Toward the close of the chapter, a date is to be determined be-yond which no proposal will be accepted. All of these provisions are to enable the committees to process the proposals properly and in due time. The General Chapter o/ Affairs / 299. The right to make proposals is determined by the law or practice of the particular institute. Those who do not have this right may suggest proposals, preferably in writing, to ~those who do enjoy the right. The latter may but are .not obliged to accept merely suggested proposals (see Review ]or Re-ligious, 23 [1964], 359-64). Position Papers and Questionnaires These were the high hurdle and wide stream obstacles in the procedure of. so many special general chapters, and few of these chapters landed fully on the opposite bank. Position papers were also at times a means on the part of committees of appropriating to themselves the policy making func-tion of the chapter. Questionnaires were frequently the substitution of a none too reasonable head count for a vote given because of convincing reasons. A background paper or questionnaire is only rarely necessary or advisable, e.g, an intelligent vote, for or against a particular proposal can demand a brief historical description. If so, the background paper should be prepared.~ Authority of the Superior General in Pre-chapter Preparation The superior general, assisted by his council, has authority over the entire pre-chapter preparation. This is evident from the fact that, outside of the general chapter, there is no one else on the general level of authority and from canon 502, which places the institute under his authority (see Ecclesiae sanctae, no. 4). Frequently at least a superior general gives ample delegation to. another religious to direct and supervise this preparation, e.g., to the Chairperson, of the steering or co-ordinating committee. However, the superior general can always lessen or~\\xe2\\x80\\x99withdraw such authority, lie may also always step in to correct and guide particular matters, individuals, or committees. Post-Vatican II general and provinc, ial chapters have often been vanquished in the pre-chapter preparation. The game was lost before it began. The superior general is not arbitrarily to interfere in or hamper the, work of the committees, but he should be completely aware of what is going on in all committees. He should be very sensitive to a too conservative or a too leftist~ approach and, even more practically, ~to a group that is unduly and wrongly influencing the pre-chapter preparation.. \\xe2\\x80\\x99 Attaining a:Universal Voice in Chapters Especially since about 1965 we have had a constant clamor that the religious of temporary vows or other commitment be permitted to be dele-gates to the general and provincial chapters. This has been an outstandingly unreal issue of recent years..The clear fact has been that the young were talking in the chapters and pre-chapter preparation. The voice that was not being heard was that of the older and of many middle-aged religious and chapter members. This has been true also in other discussion groups, for example, local community discussions. Our need and problem of the-mo- 300 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 ment is to hear the older and the middle-aged religious. I doubt that this can be attained at this time except by having the chapter discussions start with small discussion groups. Each group should be composed of religious of all ages. This system would demand a sufficiently competent chairperson and secretary in each group, the report by the secretary of the group, and the distribution of copies of the reports of each group and of the composite report of all the groups before the common discussion of the matter in the whole chapter. The attainment of the most accurate and efficient procedure in this matter demands a very thorough study. Discussion groups are a time consuming means. They could be employed only for the more serious mat-ters. My own sincere judgment, based on the observation of chapters, is that such a means is necessary to hear the voice of the older and of many mid-dle- aged religious, especially of sisters. Part of the factual basis of this judg-ment is the lack of the older and middle-aged voice manifested very gen-erally in post-Vatican II chapters, that is, the effects that.revealed an inex-perienced, imprudent, and exaggerated origin. As far back as 1901, the Roman Congregations governing religious have refused to approve those of temporary vows or other commitment as dele-gates in the general and provincial chapters. Chapter Principles The preceding section on proposals lists fairly adequately the aspects and fields that can give rise to proposals. Proposals can also be drawn from the principles that should guide chapters, communities, and individuals, which we shall give in this section. The supreme principle is that all should seek the greater good of the Church and of the whole institute, not merely of some part of it or of some group in it. Seek the good not merely of the young, but also of the middle-aged and the aged. A high degree of differ-ence in some aspect of life that is verified in any particular country or re-gion should receive its proper consideration. This is to be true not merely of the United States but of any other country, of Germany, France, Italy, England, Japan. Differences do not exist in all aspects of life. The American has no less need of prayer and mortification than the Italian. Obviously no nation is to give the impression of being superior to all other nations. All should retain all the good of the past and be willing to accept all good ideas of the present and of the future. It is equally the duty of all to oppose anything that is useless or harmful to the institute or its members. Any false principle such as disobedience, especially if public, to the govern-ing or teaching authority of the Church should be immediately rejected. The goal in prayer is not freedom but a more universal life of constant prayer. The Holy Spirit guides practically all of us by the ordinary way, and this implies that our problems, difficulties and their solution are at least gen-erally ordinary. Little will be gained from a study of oriental mysticism or concentration or from emphasizing the charismatic. Much will be gained to The General Chapter o] Affairs / 301 the extent that it is realized that the difficulties in prayer are the very ordi-nary things of the lack of desire for sanctity of life, the unwillingness to make the sacrifices that such a life demands, the lack of a realization that prayer demands a constant effort, an impersonal spirituality, a poor introduction to mental prayer, a complicated system or machinery of mental prayer, a neglect of spiritual reading, a life that is merely activist, natural, secular, and similar ordinary things. If a chapter accepts open placement, how can the institute staff missions, colleges, hospitals, schools, homes for the aged? Can there be a generally satisfying community life when there is unlimited home visiting and unlimited going out for diversion? W.hy always leap to the new, the youthful, the leftist? Certainly sometimes the old, the moderate, the conservative is the true, the relevant, the practical. Why run to manage-ment consultants before you have tried a thorough investigation, study, and planning on your own? If any advisers gave false and imprudent advice, this advice can be the perfect mirror of what was wanted. List everything that your institute has adopted in renewal and adaptation. How many of these have helped the members to become better religious, better apostles, better Catholics? It is certainly not easy to start all over\",\"neither is it any too comfortable to be on a plane that is speeding to certain extinction. The dominant thought of any chapter has to be the spiritual, the su-pernatural, the eternal not only with regard to the personal lives of the in-dividual religious but also to the apostolate and community life. Natural development and fulfillment and social work are important but not primary, nor are they the soul of the religious life or of its apostolate. Reject ideas and proposals that are disproportionately expensive. All experimentation in the Church and much more its worship should be carried out in a manner that is adult, mature, dignified, restrained rather than undisciplined and reckless, and not marred by the extremes of either the right or the left. The common saying is that religious dress is not an important question. This is true of religious dress in the abstract and considered merely in itself. In its effects and ramifications, religious dress, especially of women, is certainly an important question. In the past the error was to identify the old with the true, the good, and the relevant\",\"the same error is verified now with regard to the new. Re-evaluate every post-Vatican II experiment and change. In-vestigate every question and adopt the solution that the facts demand or counsel\",\"do not start off with a new structure or theory. The goal is only secondarily to renew and adapt the institute\",\"the primary purpose must be to influence the religious to renew and adapt themselves. The thrust is pri-marily personal, not institutional. There is one essential test of past, present, and future experimentation. Does it produce greater sanctity of life, a deeper and wider community life, a greater spiritual effect in the apostolate? One of the most important qualities demanded in superiors and chapters today is the courage to stand with the wise and oppose the foolish. How many of your schools, colleges, and other institutions are very secular? Can you 302 / Review ]or Religious, Volume 33, 1974/2 justifiably allow this to continue and progress? Take anything and every-thing that is good and helpful from psychology and sociology, but never forget that they are no substitute for revelation, morality, or spiritual theol-ogy. How many factual studies were made that proved the later difficulties and defections of religious were found especially in those who entered im-mediately after high school? Honestly face the vocation problem and any of its causes that may exist in the individual and collective lives of your re-ligious. It is possible to emphasize the dignity of the married life without denigrating the religious life. Is the life style of your religious in conformity with the deep totality of the religious consecration? Do all things conduce to greater sanctity, better community life, and a more spiritual apostolate? Are we complaining about the lack of inspiration in the religious life after we buried it in selfishness, materialism, and naturalism? Adopt only what gives at least solid probability of success\",\"otherwise your conduct is at least ordinarily imprudent or even rash. Procedure in lhe Chapter The chapter procedure should be kept as simple and uncomplicated as possible. The need of recourse to parliamentary procedure should be infre-quent, and each institute is now in a position to list the few parliamentary rules that are practical. The secretary of the chapter is to post the agenda for the sessions of a day at least on the preceding evening. It can be the understanding that the proposals or matters are to be taken in the order of the reports distributed to\"],\"format\":[\"PDF\"],\"identifier\":[\"http://cdm17321.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/rfr/id/530\"],\"language\":[{\"name\":\"English\",\"iso639_3\":\"English\"}],\"rights\":[\"Copyright U.S. Central and Southern Province, Society of Jesus.

WHAT SHOOTING DOES FOR THE SHOOTER. All forms of sport have an effect on those \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ho play them and the effect on the player is often n dcterminin factor in the value of the sport. In many way:; shooting with a shot\\xc2\\xadgun, rifle or pistol either at a target or hunting in the lield is an especially \\\\\\\\\\'alttahle sport. It gives recreation and in addition develops to a high degree the mental faculty of concen\\xc2\\xadtration, and in fact a shooter\\'s suc\\xc2\\xadcess depends to a very large extent upon his ability to concentrate and co-ordinate the effort of every nerve and muscle 1to get the desired result. Slip- hod and careless people never become e~pcrts either os hunters or target shooters for they will not de\\xc2\\xadvote the necessary energy and thought to their problems. Consequently the man who makes a ucces of shooting is necessarily the one who can keep his mind working along the proper c-hannels. Boys and young men a.re often lacking alonrr th,\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s&quot; lines and that is o11e of thr reasons why shooting should he ,\\xc2\\xb7nconragccl especially in school and eo! leges. \\\\\\\\nother feature of shooting, and one which is rather important is th train\\xc2\\xading of the ~hooter\\' , t\\'ye. m. n wf10 ha. done a great deal of hooting, especially hunting, develop keen powers of obs rvation and u ually set\\'. things m re quickly and accurately than the average man who has never used his eye citht\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r to locate wary game or to make close visual adju t \\xc2\\xadments such as are nece. ary in prop\\xc2\\xadt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rly lining up the ights of a firearm .

H: STEVE~ S Mr. Stevens i now and was last year the manager of the trapshooting school in Atlantic City, N. J. lie is a student of trapshooting and on idered one of the most efficient instructors in the United States. Therefore his views on this subject are worth while. JUST as long as the earth revolves there will be people insisting that expert marks\\xc2\\xadmen are born-not made. My experiences as manager of the Trapshooting School on the Million Dollar Pier, Atlantic City, N. ]., cause me to take the opposite view-that marksmen are made not born. I had a great opportunity to study people last year at the trapshooting school and I got a lot of quiet amusement out of watching people who had never fired a gun, take to the sport like a duck to water. There was more fun still in coaching experienced shooters out of the &quot;SO-SO&quot; class. Of course, in the case of a raw beginner there may be need for but very little instruc\\xc2\\xadtion, or he may require a great deal; but at the worst it is simple, because he has formed no habits. llaving by a few simple t~sts de\\xc2\\xadtermined the eyesight presents no dtfficulty, and selected a gun with a stork o \\xc2\\xa3 a shape to fit reasonably well, then a little instruction in handling the gun usually starts him break\\xc2\\xading targets. The rest is a matter of. refine\\xc2\\xadment in gun fitting, coaching and practtce. Naturally, some beginners make progress faster than others. But it is not that one is endowed by nature with betler shooting ability than the other, but that he simply learns quicker and better. The most common of all faults and which most handicaps almost every beginner and every dub shooter, is a bad shooting position. This can be corrected, in most cases, very easily by coaching. Possession of a gun which does not fit the shooter cannot be correctly called a fault; rather, it is a misfortune. The beginner. in wing-shooting knows nothing about selectmg a gun to fit him. And I usually find that the man who comes along and confesses to me that he had some experience but is a poor shot has been handicapping himself with a misfit gun. Generally he doesn\\'t even know the dimensions of his gunstock. Reverting to the subject of position, the be\\xc2\\xadginner and very often the dub shooter, when taking up a gun for the first time. at the sc??ol, would assume a decidedly stramed pos1hon, holding the gun awkwardly and balancing at the waist with hips thrust forward and shoul\\xc2\\xad&lt; lers back. :t-laturally, each had to he taught to stand firmlv on both feet, lean slightly for\\xc2\\xadward and swii1g freely from the hips. For another thing, sometimes the beginner showed an apparently unbreakable destre to raise the check from the gun stork when the target appeared in Hight, and, of course, con\\xc2\\xadtinued to miss until he learned better. Other grave faults were inclination to hold too long on the target before ftring, and flinching. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ithout coaching the tyro \\\\\\\\yon!~! not easily outgrow these faults, but wtth tt rapid progress was always made. I have fonnd it interesting and useful to study the beginners from the human-nature standpoint. For instance, supposing a new man comes along: it may be a good thing to just let him find his way around, so to speak, and not give him too much attention. TT e gets a gun. and you sec at once if )1e is familiar with it. J f not, you will see hun watching the other shooters.

SOME men ju&gt;t naturally cannot keep from hitting game. They are born ~ho t5. Maybe it ih the gun used, im;tead of the man, but at any rate we have all met the fellow who kills game with uncanny regularity. nder ordinary circum\\xc2\\xad\\' tances, seeing is believing, but when it come5 to fishing and ~ hooting yarns, we long ago adopted the rule to believe nothing that we heard and only half that we 5aw. The illustration on this page shows you what we have 5een and we are going to tell you the tale as told to us. You can give the credit to either gun or gunner, as you see fit. On December 15, 1918, George S. Scofield, a lawyer with offices at Room 2289 Woolworth Building, New York City, and Capt. George Ackerly, a professional guide of Patchogue, Long Island, were shooting ducks from a double battery on Great South Bay. In this form of shooting the gunners lie side by side in the coffin-like compartment of the battery which is anchored off shore. As the duck5 come into the decoys which surround the battery, the gunners sit up and open t1re. A flock of broadbills decoyed. Both gunners rai,rd and fired one barrel. For the second shot Mr. Scofield was following a bird fairly well up in the air, while Captain Ackerly had picked out a bird closer to the water. Just a5 1\\\\\\\\[r. Scofield was about to pull the trigger, his bird crumpled and fell and he felt a jar as though his gun had been dis\\xc2\\xadrharged. However, he knew he had not shot and on opening his gun, he found the \\xc2\\xb7shell had not been fired. 1\\\\\\\\Ir. Scofield explains the incident in this way, and he has the gun to prove it. Just as he was about to fire, Captain Ackerly, swinging ahead of his bird, pulled the trigger. The charge from the Captain\\'s gun hit the barrels of Mr. Scofield\\'s gun about SL&quot;&lt; inches from the muzzle, entered the left tube and followed on out the barrel, killing the duck that Mr. Scofield was aiming at. This barrel was almo5t entirely clo&gt;ed and had Mr. Scofield pulled the trigger, the gun would undoubtedly have blown up and possibly killed both gunners. There you have ill Some men just naturally cannot help killing ducks, or maybe they train their !(Uns so no effort on their part is necessary. 13~ rl.~!J-~~&quot;:&quot; ~ oli,\\'~ \\':J.~, 16fl \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 15.

Vertical Firing. 737J77,7,y. 20:ct. ~, w 1 JffZ\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 : _,,,, 62 Vertical Firing Editor Outdoor Life.-After reading Mr. Thomas\\' article on &quot;Star Hunting&quot; In the September issue it occurred to me that perhaps the results of some experiments on this line and the computations on altitude, time of flight, etc., might be of Interest. In the first place he has evidently been misinformed as to the range of the Spring\\xc2\\xadfield rifle, as he gives it as between seven and eight surface miles. Springfield, but can submit some on this work with the English service arm. The English Mark VII bullet weighs 174 grains and the velocity is 2,440 t. s., so there is after all not so very much difference in the ballistics of the two cartridges at long range. Mr. Tippins and other well-known Eng\\xc2\\xadlish rinemen have succeeded in timing the flight of vertically fired bullets. The Ordnance Department gives the ex\\xc2\\xadtreme range of the Springfield as 6,4Gfi yards, or a trifle over three miles. In this shooting the firing Is done at an angle or 45 degrees. The highest point of the tra\\xc2\\xadjectory is 6,844 feet and this height is reached at a distance of 3,432 yards !rom the firing point. The angle of descent Is about 68 degrees and the bullet strikes the ground with a remaining velocity computed at 203 ft. sees. Time of flight computed at 31 seconds. One or their interesting observations is that it strikes the ground with its point in the same direction as it leaves the gun. If fired straight up it comes down base first. The table or computations on vertical firing with English service ritle is as fol\\xc2\\xadlows : Height Velocity. Ascended. Time of Ascent. (Feet per second) (Feet) (Seconds) 2,440 0 2,400 59 2,000 680 1,500 1,569 1,000 3,238 500 7,139 0 9,816 0.00 0.02 0.31 0.84 2.22 7.68 19.66 Like many other readers of Outdoor Life, I began my shooting with sllng\\xc2\\xb7shot, cross\\xc2\\xadbow and bow and arrow. From what I could see of the flight of the projectiles I used I always supposed they carried far\\xc2\\xadther when fired at an angle than when shot straight up. So sure did I feel of this that I told a friend that in my opinion the Springfield would only shoot about two miles straight up. The bullet takes 31 seconds to reach the ground in its return and strikes the ground with a velocity of 473 feet per second. I have no data on vertical firing with the To settle a dispute could you please tell me whether a bullet fir d straight up from a Springfield rifle will reach the ground at the same velocity as It left the rifle? Will the bull t fall base or point first and what will be tho energy when It hits the ground? Also, how high will the bullet go?- I-I. N. Anderson, Portland, Ore. Answcr.-The bullet would strilte the ground with a small fraction of the velocity It possessed when It left the muzzle for the reasons given In the reply to Mr. Malone In this Issu e. If you have disturbed Its flight It would strike base first, but they occasion\\xc2\\xadally tip over and fall point first, In which case the velocity at strildng Is decidedly higher than In case where they come down base first. We have no data as to how high this particular bullet would go. The dis\\xc2\\xadcussion you have In mind will be found In the January, 1915, Issue of Outdoor Life, pages 88 to 90.-Edltor. () -1.4 .. , a-,., I \\'f 17. If a rifle were shot vertically and after the bullet came back to earth would the speed per second be the same as when It left the rifle, or less. If a round ball weighing a pound, and an ordinary buckshot, were dropped from an aeroplane a mile In the air, would they reach the earth at the same time? Both of these questions to be practical, tak\\xc2\\xadIng Into consideration air resistance, etc.; not as to textbooks on physlcs.-Carl Mahone, Cleveland, Ohio. Answer.-The bullet on striking the earth would have much less velocity than when It started upward for the reason that many times as much of thE!- energy of the bullet Is absorbed in overcoming air resistance as In overcoming the attraction of gravitation. The energy thus lost Is lost forever. On the return trip there Is likewise a great deal of energy absorbed by the resistance of the at\\xc2\\xadmosphere, and this, likewise, Is lost. The energy the bullet possesses when It strikes the earth Is that absorbed on the upward trip in overcoming the attraction of gravita\\xc2\\xadtion. Touching the dropping of the ball and the buckshot this would depend altogether on what the ball were made of. If it were lead the larger ball would reach the earth more quickly than the buckshot, as It would over\\xc2\\xadcome the air resistance better. If it were o! lighter material It would depend upon Its specific gravlty.-Edltor. California. E. L. STEJVENSON. Some weeks ago I replied In your valuable magazine to one &quot;Bill&quot; as to bow high a rifle will shoot. I also spoke of a question in mental \\xc2\\xb7arith\\xc2\\xadmetic as to how a, person could in\\xc2\\xadcrease his weight while standing on the scales by lifting up as much as possi\\xc2\\xadble, or by reaching up and pushing up with all his force on the beam of the scales. .I asked Mr. Chauncy Thomas why it was so that my weight would increase according to the amount of pressure exerted, to which Mr. Thomas replied: &quot;Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Impossible.&quot; That gentleman knows very little of Euclid, for it certainly increases your weight, according to the amount of pressure you exert over your own weight. Mr. T. has not tried it, hence he does not speak with the knowledge of &quot;proof.&quot;- E. M. Herron, Cleve\\xc2\\xadland, 0. Answer.-Mr. Thomas was certainly most disrespectful. A man would show \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the same increase in weight under the circumstances mentioned as a spring would thru being placed in tension. Un\\xc2\\xadfortunately very few scales are suffi\\xc2\\xadciently sensitive to measure this.\\xc2\\xadEditor. 72.

D. Answer.-In answ ring your question we cnn glvt&gt; only our p rsonal Impres\\xc2\\xadsions. When nny rltle Is !Ired It is thrown Into a state of vibration thru Its entire length, th vibrations beginning with the jar of th hammer !nlllng, be\\xc2\\xadIng Increased by th explosion of the primer and still mor so by the ignition ot the charge, and this regardless of the type of weapon fired. Obviously ljeavy barr~?ls vibrate less than light, and heavy guns less than light. The vlbt\\'a\\xc2\\xb7 tlon originates In the barr 1 and Is transmitted thruout the gun. The best shooting Is obtained when the entire iJ\\xc2\\xadfle vibrates as unltormly ns posstble. For this reason the more tightly the barrel Is screwed Into the action the more uniformly will the entire rille vi\\xc2\\xadbrate, but there Is always Interruption In the vlbrat~on at th\\'ls point. The utility or the one-piece stoclt rs In that It passes this point ana tends to distribute the vi\\xc2\\xadbration uniformly over the entire gun, hence a rifle with a one-piece stoclt shoots more accurately than ~ rltl.,; with n two-plec stock. While on with a two-plec and the barrel screvt,ed tight \\xc2\\xadly Into the action shoots more accurate\\xc2\\xadly than one with n two-piece stoclt, the barrel of which Is loose In th ac\\xc2\\xadtion. The joint wh re the barrel joins the receiver Is the point wher\\xc2\\xb7c the mis\\xc2\\xadchief Is &lt;lon . vVo nrc nwnro that this may cause many of our renders to !m\\xc2\\xadmedlnt&lt;\\' ly declar they have s&lt;\\xe2\\x80\\xa2en thl\\' best results from guns wlth two- piece storks, ven Stevens target rilles, the barrels of which arc scr w d loosely 1 nto the ncllon and fastened wllh a set scr w. There Is no question but some of the latter type of rifles have given most extreme accuracy, This we co n\\xc2\\xadsider due to the fact that they w ere shot I unci P target conclltlons where the meth\\xc2\\xadOd of holding was absolutely uniform, and consequently the vibration, wh ll ~ excessive, was uniform, and thus gave uniform results.

Nature\\'s Healing Process in Animals Editor Outdoor Life:-If you wish to see a remarkable mending of a shattered jaw\\xc2\\xadbone I will send you the bear\\'s skull that I mentioned in a former letter. This bear had been shot by a hunter a year or so (possibly longer) previous to my killing him, but thru the healing process of nature had been able to eat and masticate his food and finish Ufe in the full vigor of healthy bearhood. He must, of course, have suf\\xc2\\xadfered much in the early days of the injury and until the fragments of bone had healed sufficiently to hold the jaw in a steady position while eating. The bone is not completely mended and shows a process that is wonderful. It also shows the lack of penetration in light, high\\xc2\\xadpower bullets when they get up against any-thing that Is hard and tough, and yet loose enough to give. The mark of the bullet on nose of slmll Is healed, but It may be located by the unhealed, rough break In the bone on under side of entrance wound. (Fig. 2). The lower jaw was entirely cut In two (Figs. 3 and 4), as is shown by healing process, and much gristle, or partly formed bone, came away with the flesh when the skull was boiled, to clean it. Until I boiled the skull I did not discover the character of the wound, or would have used more care. The .22 bullet with which I finished the bear was a Remington hollow point, and ap\\xc2\\xadpears to have expanded some In the skin before striking the bones- this bullet is in the base of the skull. I did not discover it A BEAR\\'S BROKEN JAW THAT HEALED. Fig. 1-Where bullet entered thru right nostril. Fig. 2- Where It broke thru upper jaw. tearing out most of the teeth of that member. Fig. 3-Where It tore Into lower jaw, breaking the bone in two places, at Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Figs. 4 and 6-New bone formed over the old extending under jaw for 4 in., encircling the breaks at 3 and 4 and holding them firmly. until after the skull was cleaned, and it lays exactly as it lodged after passing thru the bear\\'s brain-fired out of a .22 Reming\\xc2\\xb7 ton repeater. You might be curious to know how I came to have the .22 with me: I was horse\\xc2\\xadback, and had both .22 and .30\\xc2\\xb730 on my saddle, and made a long shot with the .30 and broke the bear\\'s back-finishing him with the .22 for the sake of the skull. You will be surprised to learn that with only one side of his face in working order the bear was fat, and that in .August, also his skin (fur) was good-$10 worth. In this letter I enclose the .25 bullet that smashed the bear\\'s jaw. It was badly used up before it lodged, as you can see, but the smooth case proves it a .25-35. Colorado. .A. C. ROWELL. Note-There are many sportsmen who be\\xc2\\xadlieve that some animals may not feel pain as keenly as others. How true this is can only be coniectured, but we had an experi\\xc2\\xadence in Wyoming once with a grizzly that made us wonder some about it. We shot the bear first thru the hind foot while he was traveling broadside to us, the bullet breaking two or three of the bones just above the toes and emerging at the side of the foot. Thru this exit the blood flowed just enough to show a little red spot in the snow about the size of a half dollar at the side of his foot print. The print of the foot was very clearly seen In the fresh snow and showed that the bear had not spared that foot at all, but apparently had put as much weight on It as on the other feet. We have often wondered If the sense of pain might not have been somewhat deadened in this instance by the excitement of the chase, for we were hot on his trail for many miles, and he was also greatly aggravated by the pursuing dogs.-Edltor. The Killing Power of Bullets Lieut. Wm. H. Swett. I would like to know if anyone other than myself ever decided that the phenomenon of the tremendous rending power of the mod- I had occasion to conduct several months or experlnwnts two years ago for several of my clients to determine the exact reason for such rending, smashing and tearing power ns the military arm loaded with the Spitzer projectile Is known to have; which as every wcll\\xc2\\xb7read military and experimental rifleman knows to be directly in reverse ot the theory upon which the hard-point Spitzer was fimt brought out. To properly explain the results of these experiments would require a lot or space and a great number or diagrams. Missiles moving at the rate of 2,200 ft.\\xc2\\xb7 sec., upon impact, due to the heat gener\\xc2\\xadated, causes the splitting apart or dissocia\\xc2\\xadlion of the hydrogen and carbon and the hydrogen and oxygen contained in flesh; fats being composed of hydrogen and car\\xc2\\xadbon and water hydrogen and oxygen, either being or sufficient density to offer enough resistance to the projectile to produce the required amount of heat. As all animal tissue is composed largely of the above substances, we have the most favorable condition to produce this phe\\xc2\\xadnomenon. The peculiar wedge-shape, point\\xc2\\xaded Spitzer projectile, exposing a greater an\\xc2\\xadgle surface upon Impact to absorb the shock than does the round-nose or the flat-pointed missile, generates the greater volume ot Cuts with stream lines showing disturbed area and energy absorbed. No. 1, convex spitzer ; No. 2, concave spitzer; No. 3, round nose; No. 4, flat nose. heat and gas, aside from producing a greater volume of acute angle liquid stream lines. Hence the greater wound and increased killing power produced over those of the hard-point projectiles of other shapes, and is also responsible for the great number of newspaper articles we see about the war\\xc2\\xadring armies in Europe using &quot;dum-dum&quot; pro\\xc2\\xadjectiles. The entire trouble is that the killed and wounded soldiers are within the explosive zone, as their slashing wounds are nothing more than the results oi the explosive power of the gases generated, together with the back splash of the liquids contained in the ern high-power, as, for example, the Newton .266 high-power, is due to some other than the commonly accepted ideas or deductions. cell tissue; as for example, note the back splash from the front of a boat in rapid motion. The two causes are both brought into action more thoroughly by the wedge ot\\xc2\\xb7 Spitzer projectile than any of the others with hard points, due to its special design. \\\\\\\\V. IT.

Reverse the shape from a convex, from point to shoulder, to a concave, and w tremE&quot;n\\xc2\\xb7 dously narrow the effect in discussion. A formula can E&quot;asily be found fot\\xc2\\xb7 this action. I will herewith give a Few simple tests to demonstrate the abov statements. Taite several sheets of paper, soak to Raturatlon one-half tho numb!\\'r In animal rat and of the others but one in water, tho extra sheet ]{eep dry. Suspend these sheets in a frame, one behind tho other, about two and one-half or three inches apart; then take any of the arms uslug ammunition giv\\xc2\\xb7 ing known velocities from 2,000 ft.-sec. and up to 3,000 ft.-soc. that may be available, and fire through tho suspended sheets of paper and note results. The greasy and wet sheets will show clean-cut holes of about one inch in diam\\xc2\\xb7 eter when the .30 Governm nt \\'06 arm and ammunition is used up to about 100 yards (150-grain projectile) and a very marked decrease in diameter of hole at each twenty \\xc2\\xb7 five yards\\' gain in distance until the hole is normal. The other arms will speak for themselves in this test. I once had an OJ:)portunity in an interest\\xc2\\xading way to put into practice an idea gained from these experiments and at the same time check the results in actual practice. While deer-hunting with a .30 Government rifle, I saw a large deer take to the waters of the stream along which I was hunting. The animal swam very low in the water, with only the head exposed, and was cross\\xc2\\xading the stream in a quartering position from where I stood. I aimed just forward of the hips so as to strike the water just over the small of the back. The shock completf\\'ly paralyzed the animal. Upon examination there was a strip 3% inches wide by 10\\xc2\\xa5.! inches long from which the hair and &quot;grain&quot; or the epidermis was completely removed. There was absolutely no other sign of wound. Photographic plates made of sheets of wet and greasy paper at mo!llent of im\\xc2\\xadpact of projectile show gas and vapor rings very clearly. Unfortunately I have none of the photos on hand at present, and as they all went to France, I do not think I can se\\xc2\\xb7 cure any of them for publication. 102. 110. INT~ IOR BALLISTICS. 110 11~.

These special machine-gun cartridges are employed by German airmen Special Machine-Gun Bullets for Aerial Combat THE r cent announcrement of the War Department to the efTect that th ordnance bureau has dev loped bullets of three distinct types for use of airplane fighters, lends particula.r interest to the accompanying drawing of the special bullets employed by enemy airmen. With the introduction of the armored or partly armored airplane, it has b come necessary to introduce t.he armor\\xc2\\xadpiercing bullet. In the case of the German bullet for this purpose, it will be noted that the projectile consists of a German silver jacket to take the rifling of the gun barrel, with a core of steel. Obviously, such a bullet has great piercing powers. and it is reported that the German airmen make particular efforts to disable the engine of their opponent with this type of missile. The gasoline tank being the most vulnerable member of the airplane, especially if it can be set aflame, special incendiary bullets have been developed for the aerial fighters. The German incendiary or tracing bullet is hollow, and contains an incendiary matter of a phosphor base. It leaves in its wake a luminous and smoky train, destined to ignite balloons and gasoline tanks and to permit the gunner to rectify his fire. Even in total darkness, the gunner can follow the trajectory of the incendiary or tracer bullet by means of the bright spark, while in daylight he observes the smoky wake. Explosive bullets of the type shown are intended for all around purposes. Indeed, they are very much in the nature of a small shell, containing a small plunger forming a percussion firing pin over a detonating primer. It is said that this type of bullet is carried in belts and drums in the proportion of about ten to fifteen per one hundred, in German fighting planes.

Modern firearms are manufactured by machinery on a quantity basis and in the production of a new model the following steps must be gone through: \\\\\\\\~:uming that the inventor has finished a complete working model, thr first step towards putting th gun on the market is to make complete de\\xc2\\xadtailed drawings of every part of th gun. This takes considerable time as the dimensions of the various parts must be checked against each other, so that the allowable limits in the :&gt;ize and shape of the parts will always produce a perfect working mechan\\xc2\\xadism. I Aft r the drawings of the parts arc completed, proce s engineers tak each individual part and decide on just how it is to be mad from the raw material to the fini h d part, and then also decid on th\\' kinds of ma\\xc2\\xadchines to be used. After that the plans go to tool d sign r who make drawings of the fixtures and jigs nec\\xc2\\xadessary to hold the work for ca h op\\xc2\\xaderation and th cutters which cut away the steel or wood to hapc the parts. These drawing arc sent to the tool room where the fixtures and other tools are made, and after that another gang of skilkd m chanics set up the machines and get them work\\xc2\\xading properly. These machines are then turned over to the machine hands who arc to operate them, and the manufacture of parts is begun. At every step of the work, expen\\xc2\\xadsive, specially made gauges must be used to see that the parts are exactly the right size and hape. The secret of the a. toni~hingly high quality and low CO&gt;t of Ameril\\xc2\\xb7an made fire. rm lie in th pr tluction of many arm\\xc2\\xb7, all exactly ali \\xc2\\xb7e. \\'fher i a time interval of many. month. between the decision to man\\xc2\\xadufacture new firearm and the ap\\xc2\\xadpearance of the first model on the market and al o if production is once stoppc\\xe2\\x80\\xa2l on any model, even when everything- is ready to go ah ad, then~ will b-e everal months time between the forging of the rough tock to the final in pection of the finished arm, bee. u e each part must go through many operations in consecutive order. A part such as the receiver of a n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xc2\\xadpcating rifle or shotgun oft n requirl s as many as two or thr e hundred ~ eparatc distin t operations. mall parts such as pin and screws can of course be finished in quick time, but the complete gun must await the production of the part wh1ch requires longest to make. 192.

The simplest method i to make a cast of the chamber and send it to one o f the big ammunition com\\xc2\\xadpanics. Parafine wax can be used if y ou are cardill to get the ha rrl\\'l fair ly warm before pouring in the wax, but a better composition is a mixture of Sulphur and Graphite. Put a littk pi ece of waste or clot h. just in front of the chamber and pour the wax or SulQhttr mixture in the breech with the \\xc2\\xb7barrel poi nting towards the ground. After it has cooled off and s t. push it out careful ly by means of a cleaning rod inserted in the muzzle. New Rustless Metal Plant \\xc2\\xb7 Will Be Located in City Discoverey of Alloy By C. J . Rath; Can Be Forged Cold and Cost No More Than Iron Products. Perhaps the e~y long search nr lndu11try tor a metal which 111 lmper\\xc2\\xb7 vlous to rust and corrosion, which ce.., be twi11ted cold Into an auger or har.l\\xc2\\xb7 ened In the mukin~r 110 It m9,y be 11harpened like a razor, has ended wltn the discovery or an alloy by c. J. Rath. He cnlls It &quot;Everbrlte.&quot; Hath formerly Uved In \\'Varren, OhJo, where he 1pent many yean I working In an Iron foundry. Since boyhood, he ha. worked on the for\\xc2\\xb7 mula for a flux, or combination of chemical\\xe2\\x80\\xa2, which, 1\\'then burned with , certain metale will produce an alloy to etand up to all requirement!!. The alloy 111 made of lead, zinc, COli\\xc2\\xadper, nickel and man~raneee. The In\\xc2\\xadgredients are rlo eecret, he ald. The secret 11 the flux burned With them In a furnace which cau11e11 them to join together to make the new metal. This flux, Rath lllld, can be changed so the metal will be either bard or 11oft In any decree, It !11 tempered ln the alloying. A corporation, with $200,000 capital stock, ha.e been organized in Okh.\\xc2\\xadhoma City to mal(e this metal. A charter was applied for lut week. The temporary board ot directors Is composed of George G. Sohlberg, A. M. DeBolt, Charlel! Edward John\\xc2\\xadson, R. 0. Brewer, C. H. Russell. C. J. Rath and A. E. Kull. Rath, according to Kull, came to Oklahoma City with his proposition two months ago on request of the In\\xc2\\xb7 dustrlal development committee of the Chamber or Commerce, a committee or which Kull Js chairman. He had made one previous visit here and at that time told of his alloy to seveTal friends. He thim r-.turned to War\\xc2\\xadren, expecting to market his formula In the east, when bo was InVited to return. Under the direction of the com\\xc2\\xadmittee, samples of the alloy have been put under severe tests to dis\\xc2\\xadcover whether It would stand up to all claimed for lt. It hal! been submitted to the acid test and proved it wm not corrode, Kull said. Dr. Edwin D. Debarre, head or the departmellt of chemistry at the Unl\\xc2\\xadverstty f Oklahoma, hae made eev\\xc2\\xb7 eral ttllltll on It, according to Kull. He reporte4 It \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 restated the rust test and testa ma4e with all acids from tboM of the kltehen, 1uch all lemon Juice, to .\\xe2\\x80\\xa2troncer on\\xe2\\x80\\xa2. Doctor De- C. J. Rath. barre gave .It a tensile strength of 92,316 pound\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to the square Inch, while the tensile strength of boiler eteel Is but about 66,000 pounda to the square Inch. It bas been tested In connection with fee and ammonia manufacturing mach!Mry and has been found to wltbetand tests which eteel or plate1 Iron would suffer under. Plain cast\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 lngs made from the alloy have been hammered and twisted without break\\xc2\\xadIng. When the same tests were worked upon common Iron castings, they broke into dozens of pieces, Kull said. Its principal value, according to Kull, Ill\\'s In the fact it can be made to practically replace nickel plated brass castings and will cost less to produce. It need not be plated and wlU last Indefinitely. Casting!! manufactured from &quot;Ever\\xc2\\xadbrlte&quot; have furthermore proved they will stand high speed machining, he said. The cost of manufacturing the metal ~\\xc2\\xb7111 be about the same a11 Iron products In many cases, In a11 much as less time will be required for ma\\xc2\\xadchining. PracUcnlly no time 111 re\\xc2\\xadquired for polishing after the lathe work as the alloy comes out fn a per\\xc2\\xadfectly emooth state, he declared. The company which will manufae\\xc2\\xb7 ture the alloy in Oklahorri&amp; City wilt not spend any of Its money for pro\\xc2\\xadmotion purpose!!, Kull said. It wi!l make no campaign for the B8le of stock and Is payln!r nothlnc more tban etock fer the use of the formula.

AN IMPROVED AUTOMATIC RIFLE. THE demonstrations with the Laird Menteyne Dcgaille rifle during the Bisley week seem to have been highly satisfactory, and to have given mans who witnessed them an impression that the reliable at~comatic rifle is not so far off perfection as was generally supposed. The Degaille rifle is a full automatic repeater, which, when charged, can be completely emptied without removing the rifle from the shoulder, the trigger being pressed to fire each round as the man behind the gun is able to correct his aim after each explosion. The recoiling block, which replaces the bolt of ordinary rifles, opens and remains open after each shot, to secure greater rapidity of fire. 1\\\\\\\\ notable feature of the Laird Menteyne Dcgaille rifle is that the same clips are used for carrying the ammunition as are in use with our short service rifle; they are automatically ejected as soon as all the cartridges are in the maga\\xc2\\xadzine, the capacity of which is from five to ten rounds. The weight of the rifle is approximately the same as our service arm, has the usual safety attachments, and seems to be well balanced. During the experi\\xc2\\xadments it was firing special cartridges which we understand were made at the King\\'s Xorton Works under specifications that fulfil all the service requirements. The muzzle velocity is stated to be 2,925 feet, with a trajectory of 4 feet 10 inches at the 800-yard target. This seems to be an advance on our present arming, and the progress of this auto\\xc2\\xadmatic gun will be closely followed. When the ammunition supply prob\\xc2\\xadlem has been s&quot;olved it will probably come in with a rush.-United S crvicc Ga::ctte. WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD RIFLE ACTION? There are a number of different type,; of repeating and autoloading a tions used on r,fh: of various cali\\xc2\\xadber , from the little .22 to the power\\xc2\\xadful big game rifles. To give good result any action must be capable of handling the car\\xc2\\xadtridge from the tim it i. placed in the magazine until it is ejected after firing, with ab olute certainty. To do this, every part must be sufficiently strong to stand any train which it can be called upon to bear, and the mechanical con !ruction must be such that the cartridge is properly held in its travel from the magazine to the rhamber, and extracted with a lever\\xc2\\xadage which will insure its removal from the chamber and ejection from the arm. It is, of course, de irable to have any repeatin action as imp! as possible but it is more important to have good, solid, husky parts. There have always been, and prob\\xc2\\xadably alway wilt be, a great many ar\\xc2\\xadguments as to which type of action gives the b t results. Such an argu\\xc2\\xadment will never be settled, however, h cause th personal likes and dis\\xc2\\xadlikes of the shooter enter into the problem to a very con iderable ex\\xc2\\xadtent. One may pr f r an autoloading rifle, another one may like a sliding action forearm type, and a third may insist upon a bolt action, and all three types will give the finest kind of service if they are properly de\\xc2\\xadsigned and carefully made. The choice is therefore up to the shooter. Some hunters claim that the hand operated typ s of actions are more reliable than the autoloading types. This is not true, as autoloading rifles when gi\\xc2\\xb7ven decent treatment will give just as good serviceJ as a!l\\\\\\\\Y other kind, and you cannot neglect any kind of firearm without paying the penalty of reduced accuracy and perhaps a jammed action at a critical moment. Bolt action rifles are considered by many to be somewhat more reliable than oth r type in that they will stand more abu e without actually lying down on the job. But, on the other hand, a bolt action rifle i slower in the hands of a man who ha little opportunity to practic , and in this connection ther is one point which i not often brought up in the discussion of reliability, and that is, that an autoloading action operat s without assistance from the hoot r, which means that it will function ex\\xc2\\xadactly a well in the hands of a nerv\\xc2\\xadous, excitable man, as it will with anyone else, and there i no doubt but that a good many shots at game have b en lost thru failure in a hand op r\\xc2\\xadated action to repeat, where the fault was not with the action but with the hunter who became so excited that he failed to work the lever, or pull the slide or bolt handle to the full extent of its motion. The ensible hunter never goe on an important trip without first sight\\xc2\\xading his rifle carefully to ee that the sights line up to suit his own eyes, and he should al o thoroughly famil\\xc2\\xadiarize himself with the action so that its proper operation becomes a matter of instinct. 230.

THE 0RICII\\\\\\\\Ar. BucKHORN SIGHT I AM enclosing a rough sketch of the buckhorn rear sight that we used to make along in the early 80\\'s and later. You will notice that the sight is bored or cherried out in the back, leaving only a very thin partition of steel on the face where the head is cut, and that there arc no sharp cor\\xc2\\xadners or flat surfaces to hunt across for the notch, but that the front sight just naturally slides down ~w~ A The origi11al buckhom sight (A, cross sectio1~ B. jro11t clevatio11) a11d the modem o11c (C) fo; comparisoll into place; also that the horns overhang th notch and shade it from nearly all angles-no blurring nor glimmering, always clear and sharp. We made a notched elevator just to balance the looks of it, but never used it; just drew fine or coar e, or for extreme ranges fine or coarse through tips of horns, which are slightly separated. Soon as you learn the range of your rifle you can do remarkably close shooting with it. That and the front sight I wrote you about made a darned good combination on any good rifle. W. L.

Burclbach This is the New Lyman Mi\\xc2\\xadcrometer Windgauge Combi\\xc2\\xb7 nation Rear Sight, and it is a good one too. The Lyman People knew what they were &lt;tl01ng when they got it up. No rifleman ran alford to be compelled to guess at adjustmg his sights in the middle of a string when he can as well have a sight which will tell him exactly JUSt how much adjustment he is making on the target. As the name implies, the leading feature of this sight is its mirrometer adjustment, both on windage and elevation. The pitch of the thread on both screws is 24 to the inch. Each complete revolution is graduated into ten parts which gives a change for each click of 1/z4o of an inch, which, with a 3o-inch sight .base, equals 1- 2 minute of angle or Yz inch at 100 yards, 7.:1: inch at 50 yards, and Ys inch at 25 yards, for each division indicated on the ~-traduated sleeves or for each &quot;click.&quot; This method of adjusting sights is far superior to the old Vernier system in that it elimmates all strain on the eye and also the hazy doubt that is always present when a Vernier or common sight is used. With this sight there is absolutely no guess work. With absolute surety one can change the adjustment of the sight in the middle of a string and know that each click will change the bullet Vs o ~ an inch both in windage and elevation. Lyman sends this sight out with cup disc, and duplicate cup discs may also be had with dif\\xc2\\xadferent apertures. There is in Dorchester, Mass., a Thomas Martin who can furnish for the above sight what he calls a o. 5 Multi-aperture cup, with different apertures to fit the cup, that is a I wonder. He also makes the discs to fit his cup with square apertures. A great deal might be said about the square aperture, but the main feature of tt is that the centering effect is the same as the round aperture and that it admits 25 per cent more light, making it a great eye saver. The above sight is made for most makes of riAes. THE QUALITY OF OUR WORK ADMITS OF NO EXCEPTIOSS SPORTSMAN\\'S SERVICE STATION Where Sporl3men Gather /rom Every Part of the World. TENAFLY, N. J.

RIFLE SHOOTING IN THE DARK. T llE target made at Camp Perr) by Colonel \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc2\\xb7n1&lt;1er by the l1ght of a small bonlire, published 1n the issue of August :l, prompts a fe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ remarks. Colonel \\\\\\\\Vindt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r\\'s kat is poss1ble only w1th a t \\xc2\\xb7lescopic sight And the fact that it is poss1ble should cause our military authorities to take pract1cal notice. A lantern held by the enemy is sufficient hght for rifle lire with a telescopic sight. I ( you have a \\'scope on your nile, IL&gt;ok at a street lamp or lightetl window at any distance and obsene the cross-hairs in the \\'scope. On both Thanksgi\\\\\\\\ ing days for the yt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2ars last passed, the T\\\\\\\\:ansas City Rille Club has held a priz \\xc2\\xb7 shoot that we knew would la~t lun~ \\xe2\\x80\\xa2r than the daylight of the short \\'member days.. An ordinary hicyd lantern placed under and in front o( each target so its light shone on the target was more than ample light, as all those shooting used telescopes. t\\\\\\\\nd another thing noted hy all our shooters, the scores improved over daylight shooting. My theory of its ht\\'lng the lack of any distract\\xc2\\xading clement outside of the target, and, to the fact that in daylight the changing angle of the sun aiTects the light in the \\'scope and changes its line of sight-a good deal in some \\'scopes and very little in others To shoot accurately at night with s1ghts otlH\\xc2\\xb7r than telescopiC, would require very brilliant light at the target and some light at th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rille. A tele cope sight on the scrv1c \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rifle has been in the past consid \\xe2\\x80\\xa2red au impracticable appliance, except \\xc2\\xa3or possibly, a small per cent of expert sharpshooters. 13ut a few dozen of top notch marksmen equip\\xc2\\xadped with such sights could undoubtedly make considerable trouble at night, if some method of insuring even a little light in the vicinity of the enemy could be devised. Jt would be easy enough to pro,\\xc2\\xb7idc light for defensive purposes. hut getting the enemy to even &quot;light his pipe,&quot; when the flare of a match might be his death warrant, would be a difficult matter. 282.

Is the .35 Reming\\xc2\\xadton rimless cartridge more powerful than the .32 W. S. or .303 Savage? Answer by Ashley A. Haines.-! regret exceedingly my inability to obtain the bal\\xc2\\xadlistics for the cartridges mentioned when used with the Marble Auxiliary cartridges In rifles. Also that satisfactory ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion for testing out more than one caliber could not be obtained to furnish data for a reply to the above query. The one size tested, which gave results to be mentioned later, was for the .30\\xc2\\xb740 cart ridge used in a Winchester single-shot rifle of that caliber with Winchester soft-point, .32 Colt auto\\xc2\\xadmatic pistol cartridge. This rifle was equipped with open sights, such as I use for hunting, the distance shot being twenty\\xc2\\xadfive and fifty yards, all shooting being from rest. Fifty shots only were fired in the tests, though I used the auxiliary cartridges in this gun when bunting with satisfactory results on small game. One five-shot string at twenty-five yards gave a group in which all five shots can be completely cov\\xc2\\xadered by a 11,/,r,\\xc2\\xb7inch disc. One five-shot string at fifty yards, measuring from center of bul\\xc2\\xadlet holes farthest apart, measures as a group 2% inches. One ten-shot group at !lfty yards, measured in the same way, measures the same- 2% inches. Thirty shots, in ten-shot strings, at twenty-five yards, had they been made on the same tar\\xc2\\xadget, would all have been inside of a circle 1% inches in diameter. Twenty-eight of these shots on the same target would have been completely covered by a disc 1 \\'14 inches In diameter. The second ten-shot string, which was the smallest of the three, is shown herewith full size. Like nearly all light charges, when fired In high power ri\\xc2\\xadfles, the rltle did not shoot the above loads with sights as adjusted for the fu ll charges I had the ririe sighted for, and having but the one box (fifty) of cartridges :\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 t the time made no attempt to find the bull\\'s-eye; In other words, tested for group&gt;! only. I am pretty confident that had I held the same for all shots, the two wild ones which Second 10-shot string at 25 y&lt;ls, with Win chester .30-40 single shot rifle with Marble auxlllary chamber loaded with .. 32 Ct)\\\\\\\\t au\\xc2\\xadtomatic pistol cartridge of Winchester\\xc2\\xb7 mnkP. Open sights. Group exact size. enlarged the group to the size mentioned, would have been in the circle that would hold the twenty-eight shots had all thirty shots b en fired on the same target. At a later date I hope to have results others may have secured with these auxiliary cart\\xc2\\xb7 ridges. Also, If procurable, ballistics for same. I trl d out two other sizes, but with unsatisfactory results. Part of the ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion was very old, while the rest was of for\\xc2\\xadeign manufacture by a firm noted for let\\xc2\\xadting inferior cartridges find their way into the market. Many of the bull ~ts key\\xc2\\xb7 holed, while those that struck point , n often went wild. With good cartridges I , an sec no reason why other sizes should not per\\xc2\\xb7 form as well as the makers of the a iX!liary cartridges claim they will. Th .35 Remlng\\xc2\\xb7 ton cartridge is more powerful than the 32 Special or .303 Savage, as the following fig\\xc2\\xb7 ures will show : Energy for the .32 Special, 1,633 ft. lbs.; energy of the .303 Savage, with full metal-patched 182-grain bullet, 1,593 ft. lbs.; energy with the 195-grain, soft-point bullet, 1,658 ft. lbs.; energy of the .35 Remington, 1,776 ft. lbs.

The bear was about 125 yards from me, feed\\xc2\\xading with his head a\\\\\\\\vay from me. The bullet struck between the hind I quarters about three inches below the tail, passed into the body, and I found the jacket of the bullet imbedded in the backbone about 18 inches from where it entered the body of the bear. It crushed the backbone to powder for at least 8 inches. The bear went down in his tracks, rolled down the hill, lodging against a log, and was dead. &quot;:\\\\\\\\fter skinning out the bear we found that we could take a pointed stick and push it through the body in the region of where the back\\xc2\\xadbone had been. That part of the bear\\'s anatomy where the spinal \\'column had been was simply powdered to jelly. \\'&quot;The third .bear was also shot with , your rifle. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The bullet caught him at the base of the ear, grinding the back part of his skull and the neck as finely as they would have been ground had they passed through a sausage mill. That, of course, put the bear out of commission in a second. &quot;I am satisfied that your .256 is large enough for any of the game on this continent. This will certainly be the case when you are able to furnish the 140 grain bullet.&quot; 312. NEWTON RIFLES. OR,~ \\'l\\'f, Ill( ... z&quot; g 0 \\\\\\\\.1...). ..0. 312. ~1~.

To find the ordinate of thr trajectory at any dis\\xc2\\xadtance, that is to say the height ,of the bullet above the line of sight at any point in a range, subtract the angle of elevation for the distance at which the ordinate is required from the total angle for the range, and transform the remainder, which is in minutes, into inches, by multiplying by 1.0 17 for every 100 yards. Similarly, to obtain the drop of the bullet at any distance, multiply the angle of elevation for the distance by 1.017 for every 100 yards of the distance; and to obtain the time of flight, find the square root of the drop divided by 16.1. The ballistic co-eflicient of th bullet is .155, and with the foregoing data and formula every necessary ballistic calculation can be made. c; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ~ ;_.. A: :r..

P. LA &quot;E THE member. of the thousands of IIome D fcnse Leagu s rapidly being organized all over the rountrr are equipping themselves principally with riAc and revolver. and most of them are already practicing at the target. I will try to ct down here a few points that fri nels of mine who arc instructors are emphasizing. Such, for instanre, as the right way to hold, the right way to . ight, amount of pressure to place on the grip, position of the arm , po ition of the feet, etc., and, most im\\xc2\\xadportant of all, the correct pull of the trigger. In riAe and revolver sho ting, the ability to pull the trigger at the right moment and with\\xc2\\xadout jarring the gun in any way is an art which must b mastered before the bullets will strike the bull\\'s-eyc with any d grcc of regularity. Even if you have eyes like an eagle and ran hold as stt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2ady as a rock, the bullets arc sure to go wild if you pull the trigger with a sudden yank rather than by a steadily increas\\xc2\\xading pressure. A beginner who is just starting in at the target with the riAe or revolv \\xe2\\x80\\xa2r is adv:secl to lin \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 up the sights as well as he can and hold as steadily as possible, but, for a whil at least, do not pay special attention to these points. Your whole energy should he oncen\\xc2\\xadtratcd on pulling the trigger propt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2rly. The sights may dance around on the target in a distressing mann r and perhaps th \\xc2\\xb7y will ap\\xc2\\xadpear fuzzy at times, but when you miss the target remcmb r that yanking th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 trigger thr \\xc2\\xb7w your shot wild, for I have nev r seen a man yet who had such poor eyes or who was so shaky as to miss the target provided he could get that smooth and even I t-oll of the hammer that produce no visible jump in the gun. Some men learn how to shoot more quickly than others, ju t as some men learn how to swim or how to ride horseback more quickly than others who are not physically or tem\\xc2\\xadperamentally as well adapted. It is a rela\\xc2\\xadtively common impression that shooters are born and that if a man is not a born rifle or revolver shot, he will never become one. Such is not the case. Those of you who find the sights have edges like coarse fur and that the barrel wiggles around in a most distressing manner, should be cheered up considerably by the fact that it has been proven time and again that persistent practice will always pro\\xc2\\xadduce a considerable degree of skill. I have started in many shooters who seemed to be almost hopeless, but who in a comparatively short time produced surprisingly good scores. It will occur to many of you that practice in deliberate shooting at a large and clearly defined bull\\'s-eye on a target will never be of any practical use to you for the reason, as you will probably figure to yourself, that for home defense particularly the ability to shoot quickly and without preparation is of vital importance. In one way you are right. Slow\\xc2\\xadfire shooting is not directly useful, but it is the primary department of hooting and it teaches you the problems in a simplified form that you will be called upon to solve when you take up rapid shooting.

In other words this elevation will at 100 yards cause bullet to hit one inch higher on target: at 200 yards two incht\\xc2\\xb7s higher and so on. To illustrate: you fire a shot at the .t -inch regulati&lt; n hull\\'s-tye 100 yards and you tlnd hall strikt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s two inches below center, how much must you raise rear sight to gt\\'t up to the center of the hull\\'s-eye? :\\\\\\\\nswt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r is 2-100 of an inrh. for hy raising rear sight 2- tOO of an inch rnakt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s the line of aim and line of flight from hullt-t to h &gt;re spread 2-100 of an inch for each and every yard from muzzle of rifle to hull\\'s-eye. &quot; ,\\\\\\\\t 200 )\\xc2\\xb7ards this same 2-100 of an inch elcva: ion will equal a four\\xc2\\xadinch raise of target. therefore all that is t1t\\'cessary for anyont\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to do is to measure the distance between the sil-(hts nn your rille. then ascer,ain hy di,\\xc2\\xb7iding how many times this distann\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 will go into 100 yards or any numher of yards you desired to shnot.

Our e.\\xc2\\xb7perience . bows even wider -..aria\\xc2\\xadlions in individual eye-sight. In one in. tance -the sighting of the lady of the family and the le. ser one-third, there is a difference of from 12 to 15 inches in point of impact at the short range of 200 yards, when we usc the same rifle and think that we\\'re holding the same. Eye-sight plays the greater part in the di f\\xc2\\xadferencc, but some of it lies in the grip. Ob\\xc2\\xadserve the sudden change of lateral zero when a left-handed shooter takes over the sighted-in rifle of the right-handed hooter. \\xc2\\xb7 As secretary of a civilian rifle club for ten years, I have seen in wearying procession the coming and going of the chap who\\'s just bought a new sporting rifle, and wants some\\xc2\\xadbody to sight it in for him. At this he\\'s the exception; 49 out of 50 of such hunters bliss\\xc2\\xadfully take the factory sighting for granted, and I am under the impression that the deer family ought to take out accident policies-\\xc2\\xadmost of th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2m who do die violent deaths from gunfire, die from accident rather than from cold science and its application. Sight in the rifle for the average hunter, make two bulls at 200, and he departs that place rejoicing, satisfied that he\\'ll register ac\\xc2\\xadcordingly on the first example of ali fornia fauna he runs across. Rarely do they want to shoot the rifle; if they do, and don\\'t hit where the skilled rifleman hits, they charge it to their poor holding, and refuse sight adjust\\xc2\\xadment to correct the case. The most exaggerated case of individual peculiarities in sighting came up within a week. A chap in the club, L. Z. Dezert, firing at 200 with his .22 repeater, a most accurate rifle, asked me to try a shot or two offhand. He was getting bulls and close fours. The marker reported via insulting wigwag that the first shot was a miss. On tearful plea to take another look he found the shot in the frame at 2 o\\'clock. A second shot registered a two just below it, a third one a three just on the two-line when the rifle was held a bit lower. Then I sat down, put on the sling, and sighted in the rifle to suit me. It was aver\\xc2\\xadaging 30 inches out at 2 o\\'clock. Sighting it into the bull and running out several bulls, I turned it over to its owner, who from the same position proceeded to make 7 o\\'clock and 8 o\\'clock threes, nearly into the two-ring. He alleged that he held a &quot;fine white line.&quot; I touched the bull. There might have been in the method of sighting a 4-inch difference\\xc2\\xadthe width of a &quot;fine white line.&quot; Instead there was a difference outside this of more than two feet at 200 yards I In spite of scores of such instances, familiar to every rifleman, ordnance departments the world over continue to turn out rifles without mean of zero adjustments-&quot;sighted in&quot; for that much-discussed but non-existent chap, the average man. Yet they strive for the military ideal of 4-inch groups at 200 yards, while they fail to care for differences in sighting that may put the whole sheaf of fire two feet out at the same range.

Sporting Ranges. 544 WITH THE FIRST SHOT, AT 1500! At the request of several of our r ader who are intere. ted in the subject of the possibilitie of rifle-work at extreme rang s we take the liberty of borrowing from &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; the following mo t interesting r port of actual &quot;antelope-shoot\\xc2\\xading&quot; tests at 1500 yards by Mr. Geor C. Shumaker: &quot;A story in the gun department of an\\xc2\\xadother magazine touches again upon that 1500-yard antelope-shooting experience re\\xc2\\xadlated to us by Mr. Crossman. &quot;This much cussed and discussed episode took place quite a few years ago when high\\xc2\\xadpower ammunition was \\'young and antelope numerous. However, I read of it and all its details back in 1907 or 190 , and having had considerable experience with long\\xc2\\xadrange shooting both in caribou hunts in Alaska and general hunting in New Mexico. Arizona and old Mexico, decided to find out to my own satisfaction what could be done with arms at this outrageous range. &quot;I had killed coyotes and mountain goats up to 600 yards, and once shot a caribou in Alaska at B27 yards (measured), using in all these shots a 6Y, mm. Mannlicher, so did not think the 1500 yards range out of all reason. However, here are my experi\\xc2\\xadments. &quot;I used an antelope figure, cut from stifE cardboard, colored and sized as ncar the original as possible. Next mcasur d o!I 1500 yards and s t up my figure. Returning to the firing point I discovered that it was impossible to sec the figure over the Lyman rear and ivory front sight of my New Springfield rifle. Snag No. 1 had been struck, and the ridicule of a majority of all the critics of the 1500 yards shooting seemed to he justified. &quot;l happily recalled that the first article said something about a telescope sight, so me for it. I fitted a Stevens B-power tele\\xc2\\xadscope to my New Springfield, and after -arefully targeting the rifle on a 36-inch bull\\'s-eye at 1500 yards, tried it on my ante\\xc2\\xadlope figure. The first shot was a bull-or antelope, rather-and out of 20 shots fired at this range, 11 hit the figure. I was satis\\xc2\\xadfied. The New Springfield would hit an antelope at 1500 yards, provided the range was known, the weather conditions good, and the ammunition hand-loaded. I used the 172-grain sharp-pointed bullet and 49 grains of 1908 powder. . . . &quot;For practical hunting this 1500 yards shooting was worthless, and only freak shots would connect; but at known dis\\xc2\\xadtances it was an altogether different story, and a man was certainly justified in risking a shot, if no other way could be found to get closer to the game.&quot; LONG RABGB SHOOTING. ------ 0 Long Shooting THE following answer to one of our correspondents is self-explanatory, and may be of interest to others a well: Dear Sir:-We are interested in your in\\xc2\\xadterest in the matter of &quot;Long Shooting.&quot; \\\\\\\\Vc arc as skeptical in the matter of long\\xc2\\xadrange work as the next man ; only we do not carry our skepticism to the point of disbelieving competent, reliable men :tnd expert shots when they report to us what has been done or what can be done. And the proof that that kind f men usually offer as to what can be done is to report what has been done. Also, when they re\\xc2\\xadport to us a remarkable and exceptional . performance, and call it such, we do not take it that they are telling us that they or any other man can do 1t all the time. IT cnce, we believe the so-called &quot;1,500-yard antelope story,&quot; for two reasons. First, we know Mr. Crossman and know him mighty well, and we don\\'t believe that he would tell a lie about it. (And if you knew him as well as we do you would say the sanie thing.)

All forms of sport have an effect on those \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ho play them and the effect on the player is often n dcterminin factor in the value of the sport. In many way:; shooting with a shot\\xc2\\xadgun, rifle or pistol either at a target or hunting in the lield is an especially \\\\\\\\\\'alttahle sport. It gives recreation and in addition develops to a high degree the mental faculty of concen\\xc2\\xadtration, and in fact a shooter\\'s suc\\xc2\\xadcess depends to a very large extent upon his ability to concentrate and co-ordinate the effort of every nerve and muscle 1to get the desired result. Slip- hod and careless people never become e~pcrts either os hunters or target shooters for they will not de\\xc2\\xadvote the necessary energy and thought to their problems. Consequently the man who makes a ucces of shooting is necessarily the one who can keep his mind working along the proper c-hannels. Boys and young men a.re often lacking alonrr th,\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s\\\\\" lines and that is o11e of thr reasons why shooting should he ,\\xc2\\xb7nconragccl especially in school and eo! leges. \\\\\\\\nother feature of shooting, and one which is rather important is th train\\xc2\\xading of the ~hooter\\' , t\\'ye. m. n wf10 ha. done a great deal of hooting, especially hunting, develop keen powers of obs rvation and u ually set\\'. things m re quickly and accurately than the average man who has never used his eye citht\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r to locate wary game or to make close visual adju t \\xc2\\xadments such as are nece. ary in prop\\xc2\\xadt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rly lining up the ights of a firearm .

They are born ~ho t5. Maybe it ih the gun used, im;tead of the man, but at any rate we have all met the fellow who kills game with uncanny regularity. nder ordinary circum\\xc2\\xad\\' tances, seeing is believing, but when it come5 to fishing and ~ hooting yarns, we long ago adopted the rule to believe nothing that we heard and only half that we 5aw. The illustration on this page shows you what we have 5een and we are going to tell you the tale as told to us. You can give the credit to either gun or gunner, as you see fit. On December 15, 1918, George S. Scofield, a lawyer with offices at Room 2289 Woolworth Building, New York City, and Capt. George Ackerly, a professional guide of Patchogue, Long Island, were shooting ducks from a double battery on Great South Bay. In this form of shooting the gunners lie side by side in the coffin-like compartment of the battery which is anchored off shore. As the duck5 come into the decoys which surround the battery, the gunners sit up and open t1re. A flock of broadbills decoyed. Both gunners rai,rd and fired one barrel. For the second shot Mr. Scofield was following a bird fairly well up in the air, while Captain Ackerly had picked out a bird closer to the water. Just a5 1\\\\\\\\[r. Scofield was about to pull the trigger, his bird crumpled and fell and he felt a jar as though his gun had been dis\\xc2\\xadrharged. However, he knew he had not shot and on opening his gun, he found the \\xc2\\xb7shell had not been fired. 1\\\\\\\\Ir. Scofield explains the incident in this way, and he has the gun to prove it. Just as he was about to fire, Captain Ackerly, swinging ahead of his bird, pulled the trigger. The charge from the Captain\\'s gun hit the barrels of Mr. Scofield\\'s gun about SL\\\\\"< inches from the muzzle, entered the left tube and followed on out the barrel, killing the duck that Mr. Scofield was aiming at. This barrel was almo5t entirely clo>ed and had Mr. Scofield pulled the trigger, the gun would undoubtedly have blown up and possibly killed both gunners. There you have ill Some men just naturally cannot help killing ducks, or maybe they train their !(Uns so no effort on their part is necessary. 13~ rl.~!J-~~\\\\\":\\\\\" ~ oli,\\'~ \\':J.~, 16fl \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 15.

In some later tests, when the same barrel was reduced a further five inches in length, a loss of _Q per cent in energy was recorded, which is probably explained by the fact that the burning gases give up the whole of their force quite early in the passage of the bullet through the barrel, so that the greater part of the impulse is gained by about the mid\\xc2\\xadpoint of the barrel; while for the last five inches in the case of the full length barrel the enr1gy imparted to the bullet does not greatly exceed the friction of the same again t the bore. _ VELOCITY OF .303 LEE-F.NFTELD WfTII THREE DLFFERENT LENGTHS OF 13AlU~t::L .

Vertical Firing. 737J77,7,y. 20:ct. ~, w 1 JffZ\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 : _,,,, 62 Vertical Firing Editor Outdoor Life.-After reading Mr. Thomas\\' article on \\\\\"Star Hunting\\\\\" In the September issue it occurred to me that perhaps the results of some experiments on this line and the computations on altitude, time of flight, etc., might be of Interest. In the first place he has evidently been misinformed as to the range of the Spring\\xc2\\xadfield rifle, as he gives it as between seven and eight surface miles. Springfield, but can submit some on this work with the English service arm. The English Mark VII bullet weighs 174 grains and the velocity is 2,440 t. s., so there is after all not so very much difference in the ballistics of the two cartridges at long range. Mr. Tippins and other well-known Eng\\xc2\\xadlish rinemen have succeeded in timing the flight of vertically fired bullets. The Ordnance Department gives the ex\\xc2\\xadtreme range of the Springfield as 6,4Gfi yards, or a trifle over three miles. In this shooting the firing Is done at an angle or 45 degrees. The highest point of the tra\\xc2\\xadjectory is 6,844 feet and this height is reached at a distance of 3,432 yards !rom the firing point. The angle of descent Is about 68 degrees and the bullet strikes the ground with a remaining velocity computed at 203 ft. sees. Time of flight computed at 31 seconds. One or their interesting observations is that it strikes the ground with its point in the same direction as it leaves the gun. If fired straight up it comes down base first. The table or computations on vertical firing with English service ritle is as fol\\xc2\\xadlows : Height Velocity. Ascended. Time of Ascent. (Feet per second) (Feet) (Seconds) 2,440 0 2,400 59 2,000 680 1,500 1,569 1,000 3,238 500 7,139 0 9,816 0.00 0.02 0.31 0.84 2.22 7.68 19.66 Like many other readers of Outdoor Life, I began my shooting with sllng\\xc2\\xb7shot, cross\\xc2\\xadbow and bow and arrow. From what I could see of the flight of the projectiles I used I always supposed they carried far\\xc2\\xadther when fired at an angle than when shot straight up. So sure did I feel of this that I told a friend that in my opinion the Springfield would only shoot about two miles straight up. The bullet takes 31 seconds to reach the ground in its return and strikes the ground with a velocity of 473 feet per second. I have no data on vertical firing with the To settle a dispute could you please tell me whether a bullet fir d straight up from a Springfield rifle will reach the ground at the same velocity as It left the rifle? Will the bull t fall base or point first and what will be tho energy when It hits the ground? Also, how high will the bullet go?- I-I. N. Anderson, Portland, Ore. Answcr.-The bullet would strilte the ground with a small fraction of the velocity It possessed when It left the muzzle for the reasons given In the reply to Mr. Malone In this Issu e. If you have disturbed Its flight It would strike base first, but they occasion\\xc2\\xadally tip over and fall point first, In which case the velocity at strildng Is decidedly higher than In case where they come down base first. We have no data as to how high this particular bullet would go. The dis\\xc2\\xadcussion you have In mind will be found In the January, 1915, Issue of Outdoor Life, pages 88 to 90.-Edltor. () -1.4 .. , a-,., I \\'f 17. If a rifle were shot vertically and after the bullet came back to earth would the speed per second be the same as when It left the rifle, or less. If a round ball weighing a pound, and an ordinary buckshot, were dropped from an aeroplane a mile In the air, would they reach the earth at the same time? Both of these questions to be practical, tak\\xc2\\xadIng Into consideration air resistance, etc.; not as to textbooks on physlcs.-Carl Mahone, Cleveland, Ohio. Answer.-The bullet on striking the earth would have much less velocity than when It started upward for the reason that many times as much of thE!- energy of the bullet Is absorbed in overcoming air resistance as In overcoming the attraction of gravitation. The energy thus lost Is lost forever. On the return trip there Is likewise a great deal of energy absorbed by the resistance of the at\\xc2\\xadmosphere, and this, likewise, Is lost. The energy the bullet possesses when It strikes the earth Is that absorbed on the upward trip in overcoming the attraction of gravita\\xc2\\xadtion. Touching the dropping of the ball and the buckshot this would depend altogether on what the ball were made of. If it were lead the larger ball would reach the earth more quickly than the buckshot, as It would over\\xc2\\xadcome the air resistance better. If it were o! lighter material It would depend upon Its specific gravlty.-Edltor. California. E. L. STEJVENSON. Some weeks ago I replied In your valuable magazine to one \\\\\"Bill\\\\\" as to bow high a rifle will shoot. I also spoke of a question in mental \\xc2\\xb7arith\\xc2\\xadmetic as to how a, person could in\\xc2\\xadcrease his weight while standing on the scales by lifting up as much as possi\\xc2\\xadble, or by reaching up and pushing up with all his force on the beam of the scales. .I asked Mr. Chauncy Thomas why it was so that my weight would increase according to the amount of pressure exerted, to which Mr. Thomas replied: \\\\\"Nonsense,\\\\\" \\\\\"Impossible.\\\\\" That gentleman knows very little of Euclid, for it certainly increases your weight, according to the amount of pressure you exert over your own weight. Mr. T. has not tried it, hence he does not speak with the knowledge of \\\\\"proof.\\\\\"- E. M. Herron, Cleve\\xc2\\xadland, 0. Answer.-Mr. Thomas was certainly most disrespectful. A man would show \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the same increase in weight under the circumstances mentioned as a spring would thru being placed in tension. Un\\xc2\\xadfortunately very few scales are suffi\\xc2\\xadciently sensitive to measure this.\\xc2\\xadEditor. 72.

Modern firearms are manufactured by machinery on a quantity basis and in the production of a new model the following steps must be gone through: \\\\\\\\~:uming that the inventor has finished a complete working model, thr first step towards putting th gun on the market is to make complete de\\xc2\\xadtailed drawings of every part of th gun. This takes considerable time as the dimensions of the various parts must be checked against each other, so that the allowable limits in the :>ize and shape of the parts will always produce a perfect working mechan\\xc2\\xadism. I Aft r the drawings of the parts arc completed, proce s engineers tak each individual part and decide on just how it is to be mad from the raw material to the fini h d part, and then also decid on th\\' kinds of ma\\xc2\\xadchines to be used. After that the plans go to tool d sign r who make drawings of the fixtures and jigs nec\\xc2\\xadessary to hold the work for ca h op\\xc2\\xaderation and th cutters which cut away the steel or wood to hapc the parts. These drawing arc sent to the tool room where the fixtures and other tools are made, and after that another gang of skilkd m chanics set up the machines and get them work\\xc2\\xading properly. These machines are then turned over to the machine hands who arc to operate them, and the manufacture of parts is begun. At every step of the work, expen\\xc2\\xadsive, specially made gauges must be used to see that the parts are exactly the right size and hape. The secret of the a. toni~hingly high quality and low CO>t of Ameril\\xc2\\xb7an made fire. rm lie in th pr tluction of many arm\\xc2\\xb7, all exactly ali \\xc2\\xb7e. \\'fher i a time interval of many. month. between the decision to man\\xc2\\xadufacture new firearm and the ap\\xc2\\xadpearance of the first model on the market and al o if production is once stoppc\\xe2\\x80\\xa2l on any model, even when everything- is ready to go ah ad, then~ will b-e everal months time between the forging of the rough tock to the final in pection of the finished arm, bee. u e each part must go through many operations in consecutive order. A part such as the receiver of a n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xc2\\xadpcating rifle or shotgun oft n requirl s as many as two or thr e hundred ~ eparatc distin t operations. mall parts such as pin and screws can of course be finished in quick time, but the complete gun must await the production of the part wh1ch requires longest to make. 192.

Rath; Can Be Forged Cold and Cost No More Than Iron Products. Perhaps the e~y long search nr lndu11try tor a metal which 111 lmper\\xc2\\xb7 vlous to rust and corrosion, which ce.., be twi11ted cold Into an auger or har.l\\xc2\\xb7 ened In the mukin~r 110 It m9,y be 11harpened like a razor, has ended wltn the discovery or an alloy by c. J. Rath. He cnlls It \\\\\"Everbrlte.\\\\\" Hath formerly Uved In \\'Varren, OhJo, where he 1pent many yean I working In an Iron foundry. Since boyhood, he ha. worked on the for\\xc2\\xb7 mula for a flux, or combination of chemical\\xe2\\x80\\xa2, which, 1\\'then burned with , certain metale will produce an alloy to etand up to all requirement!!. The alloy 111 made of lead, zinc, COli\\xc2\\xadper, nickel and man~raneee. The In\\xc2\\xadgredients are rlo eecret, he ald. The secret 11 the flux burned With them In a furnace which cau11e11 them to join together to make the new metal. This flux, Rath lllld, can be changed so the metal will be either bard or 11oft In any decree, It !11 tempered ln the alloying. A corporation, with $200,000 capital stock, ha.e been organized in Okh.\\xc2\\xadhoma City to mal(e this metal. A charter was applied for lut week. The temporary board ot directors Is composed of George G. Sohlberg, A. M. DeBolt, Charlel! Edward John\\xc2\\xadson, R. 0. Brewer, C. H. Russell. C. J. Rath and A. E. Kull. Rath, according to Kull, came to Oklahoma City with his proposition two months ago on request of the In\\xc2\\xb7 dustrlal development committee of the Chamber or Commerce, a committee or which Kull Js chairman. He had made one previous visit here and at that time told of his alloy to seveTal friends. He thim r-.turned to War\\xc2\\xadren, expecting to market his formula In the east, when bo was InVited to return. Under the direction of the com\\xc2\\xadmittee, samples of the alloy have been put under severe tests to dis\\xc2\\xadcover whether It would stand up to all claimed for lt. It hal! been submitted to the acid test and proved it wm not corrode, Kull said. Dr. Edwin D. Debarre, head or the departmellt of chemistry at the Unl\\xc2\\xadverstty f Oklahoma, hae made eev\\xc2\\xb7 eral ttllltll on It, according to Kull. He reporte4 It \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 restated the rust test and testa ma4e with all acids from tboM of the kltehen, 1uch all lemon Juice, to .\\xe2\\x80\\xa2troncer on\\xe2\\x80\\xa2. Doctor De- C. J. Rath. barre gave .It a tensile strength of 92,316 pound\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to the square Inch, while the tensile strength of boiler eteel Is but about 66,000 pounda to the square Inch. It bas been tested In connection with fee and ammonia manufacturing mach!Mry and has been found to wltbetand tests which eteel or plate1 Iron would suffer under. Plain cast\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 lngs made from the alloy have been hammered and twisted without break\\xc2\\xadIng. When the same tests were worked upon common Iron castings, they broke into dozens of pieces, Kull said. Its principal value, according to Kull, Ill\\'s In the fact it can be made to practically replace nickel plated brass castings and will cost less to produce. It need not be plated and wlU last Indefinitely. Casting!! manufactured from \\\\\"Ever\\xc2\\xadbrlte\\\\\" have furthermore proved they will stand high speed machining, he said. The cost of manufacturing the metal ~\\xc2\\xb7111 be about the same a11 Iron products In many cases, In a11 much as less time will be required for ma\\xc2\\xadchining. PracUcnlly no time 111 re\\xc2\\xadquired for polishing after the lathe work as the alloy comes out fn a per\\xc2\\xadfectly emooth state, he declared. The company which will manufae\\xc2\\xb7 ture the alloy in Oklahorri& City wilt not spend any of Its money for pro\\xc2\\xadmotion purpose!!, Kull said.

The dtscharge of the c~rtridge causes the breech-holt to rccod, ejecting till\\' cmp.ty shell, loadtng the new cartridgt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 and lucking the bolt auto mattcally. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\capons of this kind extst in gn\\xc2\\xb7at numbers, but nmst of them have the fault of being complicated. or arc not strong enough to wtthstand the shock of the high powt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r t\\'artridgt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s now used in the modern infantry rifles.

An ordinary hicyd lantern placed under and in front o( each target so its light shone on the target was more than ample light, as all those shooting used telescopes. t\\\\\\\\nd another thing noted hy all our shooters, the scores improved over daylight shooting. My theory of its ht\\'lng the lack of any distract\\xc2\\xading clement outside of the target, and, to the fact that in daylight the changing angle of the sun aiTects the light in the \\'scope and changes its line of sight-a good deal in some \\'scopes and very little in others To shoot accurately at night with s1ghts otlH\\xc2\\xb7r than telescopiC, would require very brilliant light at the target and some light at th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rille. A tele cope sight on the scrv1c \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rifle has been in the past consid \\xe2\\x80\\xa2red au impracticable appliance, except \\xc2\\xa3or possibly, a small per cent of expert sharpshooters. 13ut a few dozen of top notch marksmen equip\\xc2\\xadped with such sights could undoubtedly make considerable trouble at night, if some method of insuring even a little light in the vicinity of the enemy could be devised. Jt would be easy enough to pro,\\xc2\\xb7idc light for defensive purposes. hut getting the enemy to even \\\\\"light his pipe,\\\\\" when the flare of a match might be his death warrant, would be a difficult matter. 282.

Is the .35 Reming\\xc2\\xadton rimless cartridge more powerful than the .32 W. S. or .303 Savage? Answer by Ashley A. Haines.-! regret exceedingly my inability to obtain the bal\\xc2\\xadlistics for the cartridges mentioned when used with the Marble Auxiliary cartridges In rifles. Also that satisfactory ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion for testing out more than one caliber could not be obtained to furnish data for a reply to the above query. The one size tested, which gave results to be mentioned later, was for the .30\\xc2\\xb740 cart ridge used in a Winchester single-shot rifle of that caliber with Winchester soft-point, .32 Colt auto\\xc2\\xadmatic pistol cartridge. This rifle was equipped with open sights, such as I use for hunting, the distance shot being twenty\\xc2\\xadfive and fifty yards, all shooting being from rest. Fifty shots only were fired in the tests, though I used the auxiliary cartridges in this gun when bunting with satisfactory results on small game. One five-shot string at twenty-five yards gave a group in which all five shots can be completely cov\\xc2\\xadered by a 11,/,r,\\xc2\\xb7inch disc. One five-shot string at fifty yards, measuring from center of bul\\xc2\\xadlet holes farthest apart, measures as a group 2% inches. One ten-shot group at !lfty yards, measured in the same way, measures the same- 2% inches. Thirty shots, in ten-shot strings, at twenty-five yards, had they been made on the same tar\\xc2\\xadget, would all have been inside of a circle 1% inches in diameter. Twenty-eight of these shots on the same target would have been completely covered by a disc 1 \\'14 inches In diameter. The second ten-shot string, which was the smallest of the three, is shown herewith full size. Like nearly all light charges, when fired In high power ri\\xc2\\xadfles, the rltle did not shoot the above loads with sights as adjusted for the fu ll charges I had the ririe sighted for, and having but the one box (fifty) of cartridges :\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 t the time made no attempt to find the bull\\'s-eye; In other words, tested for group>! only. I am pretty confident that had I held the same for all shots, the two wild ones which Second 10-shot string at 25 y.\\xc2\\xb7:z~.21!L.AP-i\\xc2\\xa2\\'\\\\\";1r. \\'.!Jr,t-~7 \\' - \\' .2.0!\\'11 308.

The bear was about 125 yards from me, feed\\xc2\\xading with his head a\\\\\\\\vay from me. The bullet struck between the hind I quarters about three inches below the tail, passed into the body, and I found the jacket of the bullet imbedded in the backbone about 18 inches from where it entered the body of the bear. It crushed the backbone to powder for at least 8 inches. The bear went down in his tracks, rolled down the hill, lodging against a log, and was dead. \\\\\":\\\\\\\\fter skinning out the bear we found that we could take a pointed stick and push it through the body in the region of where the back\\xc2\\xadbone had been. That part of the bear\\'s anatomy where the spinal \\'column had been was simply powdered to jelly. \\'\\\\\"The third .bear was also shot with , your rifle. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The bullet caught him at the base of the ear, grinding the back part of his skull and the neck as finely as they would have been ground had they passed through a sausage mill. That, of course, put the bear out of commission in a second. \\\\\"I am satisfied that your .256 is large enough for any of the game on this continent. This will certainly be the case when you are able to furnish the 140 grain bullet.\\\\\" 312. NEWTON RIFLES. OR,~ \\'l\\'f, Ill( ... z\\\\\" g 0 \\\\\\\\.1...). ..0. 312. ~1~.

Similarly, to obtain the drop of the bullet at any distance, multiply the angle of elevation for the distance by 1.017 for every 100 yards of the distance; and to obtain the time of flight, find the square root of the drop divided by 16.1. The ballistic co-eflicient of th bullet is .155, and with the foregoing data and formula every necessary ballistic calculation can be made. c; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ~ ;_.. A: :r..

Sporting Ranges. 544 WITH THE FIRST SHOT, AT 1500! At the request of several of our r ader who are intere. ted in the subject of the possibilitie of rifle-work at extreme rang s we take the liberty of borrowing from \\\\\"Arms and the Man\\\\\" the following mo t interesting r port of actual \\\\\"antelope-shoot\\xc2\\xading\\\\\" tests at 1500 yards by Mr. Geor C. Shumaker: \\\\\"A story in the gun department of an\\xc2\\xadother magazine touches again upon that 1500-yard antelope-shooting experience re\\xc2\\xadlated to us by Mr. Crossman. \\\\\"This much cussed and discussed episode took place quite a few years ago when high\\xc2\\xadpower ammunition was \\'young and antelope numerous. However, I read of it and all its details back in 1907 or 190 , and having had considerable experience with long\\xc2\\xadrange shooting both in caribou hunts in Alaska and general hunting in New Mexico. Arizona and old Mexico, decided to find out to my own satisfaction what could be done with arms at this outrageous range. \\\\\"I had killed coyotes and mountain goats up to 600 yards, and once shot a caribou in Alaska at B27 yards (measured), using in all these shots a 6Y, mm. Mannlicher, so did not think the 1500 yards range out of all reason. However, here are my experi\\xc2\\xadments. \\\\\"I used an antelope figure, cut from stifE cardboard, colored and sized as ncar the original as possible. Next mcasur d o!I 1500 yards and s t up my figure. Returning to the firing point I discovered that it was impossible to sec the figure over the Lyman rear and ivory front sight of my New Springfield rifle. Snag No. 1 had been struck, and the ridicule of a majority of all the critics of the 1500 yards shooting seemed to he justified. \\\\\"l happily recalled that the first article said something about a telescope sight, so me for it. I fitted a Stevens B-power tele\\xc2\\xadscope to my New Springfield, and after -arefully targeting the rifle on a 36-inch bull\\'s-eye at 1500 yards, tried it on my ante\\xc2\\xadlope figure. The first shot was a bull-or antelope, rather-and out of 20 shots fired at this range, 11 hit the figure. I was satis\\xc2\\xadfied. The New Springfield would hit an antelope at 1500 yards, provided the range was known, the weather conditions good, and the ammunition hand-loaded. I used the 172-grain sharp-pointed bullet and 49 grains of 1908 powder. . . . \\\\\"For practical hunting this 1500 yards shooting was worthless, and only freak shots would connect; but at known dis\\xc2\\xadtances it was an altogether different story, and a man was certainly justified in risking a shot, if no other way could be found to get closer to the game.\\\\\" LONG RABGB SHOOTING. ------ 0 Long Shooting THE following answer to one of our correspondents is self-explanatory, and may be of interest to others a well: Dear Sir:-We are interested in your in\\xc2\\xadterest in the matter of \\\\\"Long Shooting.\\\\\" \\\\\\\\Vc arc as skeptical in the matter of long\\xc2\\xadrange work as the next man ; only we do not carry our skepticism to the point of disbelieving competent, reliable men :tnd expert shots when they report to us what has been done or what can be done. And the proof that that kind f men usually offer as to what can be done is to report what has been done.
